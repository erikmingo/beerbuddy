Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter. The higher strength and cold fermentation help to create a smooth, less fruity porter, rich in roasted malt flavors and aromas. The \u201cAdmiral\u201d Stache has a deep brown hue with a light caramel head. Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.\r\n\r\nWe first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as \u201cShake Down Nut Brown\u201d. You can guess what went wrong from there\u2026 But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.\r\n\r\nWe use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process. We want that oak character with hints of bourbon, we use 3rd run barrels for this result. Each batch has been slightly different from the last.","abv":"7","ibu":"23","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":104,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_G6lABu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_G6lABu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tmEthz\/upload_G6lABu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.071","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:35:27","updateDate":"2012-09-09 13:50:59","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":104,"categoryId":9,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Other Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Baltic-Style Porter","description":"A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance.

Two months on recently emptied Jack Daniels select barrels imparted a wonderful vanilla character from the oak and a pleasant amount of whiskey nose and flavor. All in all, I'm really proud of the hard work and effort put into this beer. Our first attempt at brewing it and our first attempt at managing barrels has paid off for everyone! Seek out this beer, but don't put it off.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port\/ whiskey\/ wine\/ sherry\/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"}},{"id":"XnPVIo","name":"(512) Wild Bear","description":"(512)'s first excursion into the world of so-called wild fermentation, Wild Bear's origins lie in our Fall seasonal, BRUIN.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.
