At the Bloomington Brewing Company, we make beers that we like to drink. That\u2019s the first rule. Great ingredients and attention to detail is the second. Our intention is not to grow a large brewery operation, our intention is to make great beer that we like to drink and to take care of our community.\r\n\r\nWe make only ales and they are available only on draft in Bloomington, Indianapolis and the surrounding communities. We do not bottle our beers. We\u2019re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap. Often it will be not nearly as good. Why? Draft beer is fresher; that\u2019s a big one. Packaging beer is a complicated process with lots of potential for bad things to happen. Once packaged, the beer is exposed to its two mortal enemies; Sunlight and time.",

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

A blend of the palest malted barley and wheat combined with a mix of American hops give this beer a sweet citrus aroma with hints of key-limes.  The smooth light body is effervescent and finishes clean and crisp.  Filtered to perfection, this beer is great for the boat, sitting around the campfire, and everyday enjoyment.",

Of course it works well with pizza and hot dogs, but try with fish, poultry, pastas and other lightly flavored entrees.",

The brewers fell in love with the endless flavor profiles available through brewing and the delicate hop profiles only available in incredibly fresh beer and want to share that love with beer drinkers from all over the Sacramento area.\r\n\r\nBike Dog is West Sacramento\u2019s first brewery and the only one in town with a tasting room. We operate a 3 barrel brewhouse (industry speak for really small) on site. Brewing small batches means the beer will always be amazingly fresh and allows for the flexibility to mix it up a little with new recipes getting brewed on a regular basis. Because it will be brewed in such small batches, much of the beer will be available only for purchase in the Bike Dog tasting room \u2014 allowing customers to see the beer go from grain to glass and hobnob with the brewers and allowing the brewers to personally nurture the local craft beer community.",

Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah. There are now more than 12 thriving brew pubs in the state thanks to Schirf and the bill's sponsor, Senator Mike Demeitrick of Price, Utah.",

We created Black Acre with the goal of contributing delicious and unique beers to the community in which we live.\r\n\r\nBlack Acre hand crafts its ales using a custom fabricated 3 barrel electric brewing system. The brewery will produce four house beers along with an ever rotating selection of seasonal and specialty beers. Distribution will be primarily though in house tap room sales although there will be limited outside distribution. Our beers are not ready quite yet, but stop by for a glass of one of our delicious guest taps and meet the staff.",

                    "description": "Finger Lakes Beer Company was established in the fall of 2009 by Partners, Wayne Peworchik & Mark Goodwin. Both Wayne and Mark were avid homebrewers for many years. Mark continued on with his brewing education by completing the Web-based Concise Course in Brewing Technology at the Siebel Institute of Technology World Brewing Acadamy from which he obtained his Certificate.   We selected our location nestled in the heart of the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of upstate New York for its close proximity to Keuka Lake and the availability for lake water for brewing. Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills. \r\n\r\nOur Brew Room features a matched Ripley 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Brewing system. The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank. The Brew Room also features 3 double wall digital temperature controlled fermentation tanks, grain mill, filter, and other assorted brewing equipment. Adjacent to the brew room is a walk-in cooler containing 8 - 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Serving Tanks and assorted keg filling and dispensing equipment. \r\n\r\nThe entrance way and tasting room offer large windows for great views of the Brew Room  as well as a large comfortable area for you and your friends to relax and visit while enjoying your favorite brews offered fresh daily. We offer tastings and growler fills of fine crafted ales and root beer all brewed on premises as well as guided tours on non-brewing days. Have your own growlers, we fill your clean growlers. Don't own one yet, no worries we have 1 and 2 liter in several styles with our logo on them.",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

In late 1990 that dream became our state\u2019s first brewpub, Lazlo\u2019s Brewery & Grill. Since then demand for our beer has grown, so we expanded our pub and Empyrean Brewing Company was born. Today we still dream big even while we hand craft our beers in small flavor\u2013filled batches. So enjoy an Empyrean beer, the taste of dreams come true.",

In addition to the growler subscriptions we will offer growler fills to walk up customers through our retail space, as well as kegs and bottle for sale. We source many of our hops locally, you can expect the majority of our beers to include locally grown hops from Wisconsin and Michigan. We have lots of other things up our sleeves, too, like using spent grain for dog treats and sharing our space with local artists.",

And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

Through the integration of sustainable production methods, environmentally conscious waste management and innovative water recycling/reclamation techniques, we hope to become a model for breweries and agricultural destinations throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nThe BrewhouseThe brew house is an engineered mix of new and old technologies and techniques. Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.",

Golden in color and flavor, this surprisingly clear wheat beer has a smooth and drinkable honey sweetness. It's finished off in the fermenter with vanilla which adds a nice level of complexity to this easy drinking beer.  A relatively light beer, it's brewed using a special mash process to give a fullness of body and smooth mouthfeel.  The fresh Florida honey in this beer makes each sip as satisfying as Florida sunshine itself.\r\nInteresting Fact: Each batch of this beer requires a over 100 pounds of honey. Now that's a lot of honey!",

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own. Thank you for your unwavering support and encouragement!",

We start with the finest malted wheat and Pilsner malt, use traditional German mashing techniques, extend the boil for extra color and ferment it with a classic German wheat beer yeast strain.  This style of beer is unfiltered and appears hazy in the glass.  Careful temperature control during the fermentation gives the beer clove, banana and even a bit of bubblegum in the nose.  The hopping is all German, with the exception of a small last minute addition of American hops.  The result is a subtle citrus aroma in this already great tasting German-style wheat beer.",

A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!",

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

Since we came from very different backgrounds with diverse sets of experiences and talents, we joined forces to create beer that can be enjoyed not only by craft beer experts, but also by those who just want something tasty to drink after going for a bike ride.\r\n\r\nThough we all got to this point in our lives in different ways, we strongly agree on West Sixth\u2019s goals. We will provide a taproom and beer garden where the beer list is never the same but that is always local. We will be a brewery that measures its success not only by making great craft beer but also by how it helps our community. We will always strive to protect our environment even if it costs us more to do so. And last, but not least, we all share a desire to create the best beer possible and to be an integral part of building a great beer culture for our great town.",

He later expanded his sales to the Seattle area via Odom Distributing Corporation, and now he personally distributes to bars, pubs, and grocery stores in Kitsap and surrounding counties.\r\n \r\nOur Tasting Room is on Bond Road between Kingston and Poulsbo.

While each rendition may have some truth to it, what it really boils down to is quite simple: Beer is fun. Brewing is fun. Drinking beer with your buddies is fun. So, why not a name that\u2019s fun? After all, we\u2019re in the business of helping people enjoy life. And we take our business very seriously. Our beers are craft-brewed for Old World taste and new world refreshment. Savored, slammed or sipped,these beers are also brewed to be sold and we plan on selling a lot of them. Aggressive marketing campaigns are in place to make sure Horny Goat Beers are on the radar of beer purchasers in select markets. Radio commercials, point-of-sale, guerilla tactics, swag, social media, you name it \u2018cause we plan on growing, and growing large quickly. Kind of like a horny goat.

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

Penn\u2019s flagship lineup features authentic German-style beers brewed in the tradition of Pittsburgh\u2019s German immigrants, according to the strict quality standards of Reinheitsgebot.  \r\nMore recently, our lineup has been expanded to include other varieties including APAs, IPAs, fruit beers, and more.  The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.",

A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

Huber Brewing Company was set in motion in 1984 with the dreams of Missouri farmboy John Huber as he tasted his first home-brewed beer. In 2003, John received a home-brew kit for Christmas from his wife and sons. It was at that moment the Huber Brew or \"Hubrew\", the Company's flagship beer, was born. In 2009, he opened up Homebrew Supply of Southeast Missouri, LLC in Jackson, Missouri. In 2011, the John A. Huber Brewing Company took root in Fruitland, Missouri. The Company is a family owned and operated business. John's sons, Matthew and Chad, assist their father in the Company's operation. John and his family have lived in Southeast Missouri all their lives. They want to share their passion for brewing, their sense of community and their comradery. Come join them.\"\r\n\r\nHubrew is a packaging brewery. We do not currently have any onsite sales or tours.",

If we could, we are undercharging for our product. However, what we can do is this: Provide you with a beverage that you can enjoy with your friends after a hardworking day, and assure you that every Old Black Bear Beer you drink will be of the highest quality and offer you drinkability and refreshment that is unmatched by any other small craft brewery ~ a real life beer you deserve.",

Adventures in biking, canoeing, and hiking that led the trio to the northern New England states allowed them to visit some of the first operating craft breweries. Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility. The three have never strayed from their plan to brew and sell the freshest, highest quality beers possible.",

However, in recent years, it has been discovered that these hops are genetically distinct from the German landrace and in fact are most likely Fuggle or a closely related hop. The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

With over 20 years combined experience in manufacturing, we decided to follow our true passion by opening Round Guys Brewing Company. The Brewery represents two long-time beer lovers who want to make great hand-crafted beer and share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe whole idea of the brewery started one evening when Rich was in a local watering hole, listening to a rather excruciating band. Rich called Scott and offered an idea that was sure to to be the key to financial freedom\u2026\u201dwe should either start a band or open a brewery\u201d. Scott quickly responded with the observation-\u201dwell\u2026 neither of us could play an instrument, so perhaps we should try our hand at brewing!\u201d\r\n\r\nWe started off small, brewing 5 gallon batches of homebrew, either in Scott or Rich\u2019s Garage. As we started to take the brewery idea seriously, we scaled up our brew house to a 55 gallon system and moved the whole operation permanently to Scott\u2019s garage in Pipersville PA. Currently the production brew house is a 7 bbl system that we pieced together.",

In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.",

This has been true since the day we quietly opened our first \u00bd barrel brewery and tap room on the west side of Decorah, IA in 2009. The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nToday, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards. We are forward thinkers and cunning crafters, quietly building our revolution. \u201cBig Beers Brewed in Small Batches.\u201d",

This has been true since the day we quietly opened our first \u00bd barrel brewery and tap room on the west side of Decorah, IA in 2009. The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nToday, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards. We are forward thinkers and cunning crafters, quietly building our revolution. \u201cBig Beers Brewed in Small Batches.\u201d",

When the lease was up, owners Bret and Janice Larson, along with their brewmaster Dave Curry and his wife Christina, decided to come together and become co-owners of their newly created Kauai Island Brewing Company, moving locations to Port Allen where they would have more space to brew the delicious beers they were known for. \r\n\r\nAfter eight months of renovation, Kauai Island Brewing Company has its home in the industrial building complex of Port Allen Center, with an industrial theme to go along with both its surroundings and purpose of crafting quality beers. Its 35-foot high corrugated metal ceilings and walls give it an open and spacious feel. The retro atmosphere with chandelier lights hanging from the ceiling, a catwalk leading to the second story mezzanine over the entrance, and picture perfect views of the sunset over Port Allen bay from the second story window makes it hard to say goodbye to this beautiful place.\r\n\r\nWe offer up to 10 of our own handcrafted in-house beers as well as several guest microbrewed beers, all on draft. If you can't stay for a pint, that's okay! We sell 64-ounce growlers that you can fill and take with you, as well as kegs available for customer pickup.",

Crisp and refreshing year-round, this American Wheat Ale pours a lazy, hazy golden color.  Its large, white, foamy head can be attributed to the generous amount of malted white wheat added to the mash. The aroma is enhanced by our fruity house ale yeast and its fresh baked bread flavors are perfectly balanced with a Cascade hop addition.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

Allergies be damned, it's time to break out those shades and soak in the sun.  Whether your idea of enjoying the longer days include gardening, lawn work, or just plain relaxing, we offer for you the Wheat Wacker, light in body but hoppy enough to know that this isn't any normal lawnmower beer.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast, we are partial to our hoppy beers, but love to experiment in the Belgian fashion.  By combining the sessionability of a witbier and the citrus qualities of Pacific Northwest hops, it gratifies on all fronts, including the warm fronts.  Is it a Belgian IPA, not really; a hoppy wit, maybe? Perfect for the summer, we think so.\r\n\r\nPilsner and wheat malt give the beer a light golden color with a subtle hint of clove and fresh cut grass.  Blending European noble and Pacific Northwest hops, the flavor is moderately spicy and citrusy.  Dry hopped like an IPA, fruity apricot notes intermingle with Belgian Yeast esters.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. A fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Appearance can be clear or with chill haze, golden to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.",

That\u2019s why she asked young Benjamin Fordham to start a brewery in the new port of Annapolis. Benjamin\u2019s passion and dedication to making the highest quality brews were evident in every pint and the colony flourished!\r\n\r\nAlmost 300 years later, Fordham brewing was re-born in the heart of Annapolis in 1995.  With the ever-increasing demand, this frothing Fordham giant was more than our small brewery could handle. In an effort to provide more people with our brews, our plucky staff grabbed our recipes and moved Fordham to its new castle in Dover, Delaware\u2026a brand new stainless steel castle of opportunity!\r\n\r\nDespite geographical changes, our brewery is happy and healthy in Dover, and more productive than ever before. Fordham Brewing remains true to its roots, its recipes and Annapolis heritage.",

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.",
