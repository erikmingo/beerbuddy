                    "description": "The Great Crescent Brewery beers are made with all malt, fresh hops and whole ingredients. Every beer is hand-crafted in small batches using traditional brewing methods. We package our beer in self-pressurizing mini-kegs that hold the equivalent of a case of beer, half\u2013gallon refillable growler bottles and 1/6 barrel (5 gallon) kegs that can be used in commercial and home draft systems. Some of our specialty beers, like our Cherry Ale, will only be available in limited quantities.\r\nWe are a production brewery that sells beer right from the premises. Although we don\u2019t currently have a tasting room where we can sell beer by the glass \u2013 we will be offering samples to help you decide which beer to purchase.\r\n\r\nWe are open to the public Wednesday-Friday 2pm to 7pm, Saturday 12 (noon) to 7pm and Sunday 12 (noon) to 4pm. You can purchase our beers outside of the brewery at The Pour House in Aurora, Indiana, Bakers Discount Liquors in Rising Sun, Indiana and Whitey\u2019s in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. We are also available on draft at Bourbons Bar & Grill in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.",

In addition to the usual 2-row malted barley Frosted Fields uses a blend of white and red wheat malt. If we could put this one in a category, it would best fit the double-wit style, but has the addition of high alpha Summit hops to enhance the bitteness and flavor. The citrus flavors of the corriander and the sweet and bitter orange touch on the times when we sit warm inside munching on nuts and some fresh citrus fruits to take the edge off the cold outside. We will be tapping the first keg on New Year's Eve at the brewery and it will then be available in Pint Cans, Growlers and Kegs.",

And then prohibition shut it down. Re-established in 2007, we are honored to say that four months and four beers in, Mission was awarded two national medals at the Great American Beer Festival. Fast forward to 2010 our plunder of precious beer medals has gown considerably. Three Gold, three Silver and two Bronze medals now fill our bounty. A dream come true for long-time die-hard home brewers. From modest beginnings to a state of the art custom made brewery in the historic Wonderbread building just east of San Diego\u2019s baseball stadium Petco Park. Our brewery should be brewing beer with in the month. Soon therafter our tasting bar will be open to the public. There\u2019s nothing more enjoyable than a pint while watching the beer you\u2019re drinking being made a few feet from where you\u2019re sitting.\r\nNo catchy gimmicks. No national campaigns. Just great handcrafted beer made in San Diego!",
