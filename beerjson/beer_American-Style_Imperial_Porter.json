Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.\r\n\r\nGypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013. Some of our first batches might be a crisp, spicy rye abbey ale, a rich, golden Belgian tripel, and a hop-focused pale ale made with clean, slightly acidic champagne yeast.",

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.",

They roast and brew their coffees with the same dedication to quality and craftsmanship that we focus on here at Kane. We couldn\u2019t think of a better group of like minded people to work with on a collaborative project. The result is Morning Bell, our imperial milk porter brewed with their dark roast Sumatra coffee. We added a healthy amount of milk sugar to an already complex, dark malt bill to sweeten and balance the bold flavors and roasty bitterness of the coffee. The result of this collaboration is a full bodied porter with big bold flavors and remarkable smoothness.",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.",

            "description": "When Parisi and Stone brewmaster Mitch Steele decided to collaborate, it was essential that they tap a special individual to complete their triad of fermentation domination, and they found just that in Tonya Cornett, the brewmaster at Bend, Oregon's 10 Barrel Brewing Company. Together, they decided on a sturdy yet velvety base of imperial porter and developed a plan to celebrate the bounty of the environs in which it was produced by harvesting avocado honey, jasmine and calendula flowers (some from our very own Stone Farms) and infusing them into the beer to create something complex and uniquely Southern Californian. Consider it craft cross-pollination at its finest.",

Ekim\u2019s porter is well-and-truly USA-ified! This intensely dark and luscious brew is defined by its mild, fruity American ale yeast, and loads of American Centennial hops added during the boil as well as in dry-hopping, thus imparting intense spicy, citrus and piney aromas and flavours into the beer. These flavours are further enhanced and complexified by the roasty, chocolate/caramel malts, and balanced by a moderate-firm bitterness, creating a rich, smooth and well-rounded beer.",
