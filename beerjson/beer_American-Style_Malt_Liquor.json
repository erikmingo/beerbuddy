And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

Some American malt liquors are just slightly stronger than American lagers, while others approach bock strength. Some residual sweetness is perceived. Hop rates are very low, contributing little bitterness and virtually no hop aroma or flavor. Perception of sweet-fruity esters and complex alcohols (though not solvent-like) are acceptable at low levels. Chill haze and diacetyl should not be perceived.",

And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

                    "description": "A name as important to the success of Detroit as Ford or Chrysler, the Stroh family began with humble roots, brewing beer in a family-owned inn during the 18th century in Kirn, Germany. In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany \u2013 the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today\r\n\r\nAfter establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.\r\n\r\nThe Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies. He also introduced a light beer, Stroh's Light.\r\n\r\nThough the brewery encountered many difficult times, the tradition and quality of Stroh's has never changed, and the quality of Bernhard's family-owned beer continue today, with Stroh's and Stroh's Light.",
