                    "description": "We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because\u2014like today\u2014we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.  \r\n\r\nThere was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local charities.",

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

Inspiration struck during a ski trip to Vail, where other craft brewers began. There was the realization that Ellicottville, sometimes referred to as \"the Aspen of the East\", would be the perfect location for a craft brewery & grill.\r\n\r\nAfter 10 years of building a successfull brewery & restaurant in Ellicottville, our team ventured to open a second location where we could build on our brewing & culinary talents. EBC West opened June 1st, 2005 in the fun-filled college town of Fredonia, home to SUNY Fredonia.",

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

Fast forward to 2010 our plunder of precious beer medals has gown considerably. Three Gold, three Silver and two Bronze medals now fill our bounty. A dream come true for long-time die-hard home brewers. From modest beginnings to a state of the art custom made brewery in the historic Wonderbread building just east of San Diego\u2019s baseball stadium Petco Park. Our brewery should be brewing beer with in the month. Soon therafter our tasting bar will be open to the public. There\u2019s nothing more enjoyable than a pint while watching the beer you\u2019re drinking being made a few feet from where you\u2019re sitting.\r\nNo catchy gimmicks. No national campaigns.

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

The roasted malts give the beer its dark color as well as its intense flavor and aroma. The flavors of toffee and chocolate are prevalent but not overpowering. The beer is hopped with Willamette hops. Since the beer gets so much flavor from the malts there is not a lot of hop flavor. There is just enough bitterness to complement the sweetness of the malt. Finally, freshly shucked Louisiana oysters are added to the boil. The salt from the oysters gives the beer a more intense aroma and mouthfeel.",

People often ask us why a global company that\u2019s in the business of science also owns a brewery. Well, to make a long story short, my forefathers in Ireland had their hand in the brewing business and crafting beer casks when barrels were made out of wood.\r\n\r\nToday, my own family is in the business of making yeast that happens to also go into the making of beer. So, it was a natural for us to revive the brewery that has been in Lexington since 1794. Welcome and enjoy.",

We brew high quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron, Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.",

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",

With our unique touches on classic styles and our constant efforts to innovate and lead craft brewing into new, uncharted territories, even the most discerning palates will find something they love. Two year-round offerings, four seasonals and a series of four big-bottle beers will make sure of that.\r\n\r\nThe City: Considered to be the epicenter of the American craft brewing resurgence, Portland, Oregon is home to more breweries than any other city in America.

Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.

Crafted by Head Brewer Jonathan Reeves, this beer is brewed in the British and Irish tradition of oyster stouts.\r\n\r\nWe steep War Shore\u2019s Chesapeake Bay oyster shells in the brewing water to add mineral content and then add the oysters and their liquor to the brew during the boil. The oysters add a subtle whiff of a sea breeze, a slight briny character and a smooth textural element to the beer.\r\n\r\nRevival Stout is available on draft only, in Port City\u2019s Tasting Room, and on tap at select oyster houses, restaurants and bars in DC, Maryland and Virginia. Additionally, five percent of the sales of Revival Stout will be donated to the Oyster Recovery Partnership to support their efforts to revive the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.",

Benjamin\u2019s passion and dedication to making the highest quality brews were evident in every pint and the colony flourished!\r\n\r\nAlmost 300 years later, Fordham brewing was re-born in the heart of Annapolis in 1995.  With the ever-increasing demand, this frothing Fordham giant was more than our small brewery could handle. In an effort to provide more people with our brews, our plucky staff grabbed our recipes and moved Fordham to its new castle in Dover, Delaware\u2026a brand new stainless steel castle of opportunity!\r\n\r\nDespite geographical changes, our brewery is happy and healthy in Dover, and more productive than ever before.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla. The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter. There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much. Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer. As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish. The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel. The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter.\r\n\r\nImperial Pumpkin Stout",

While each rendition may have some truth to it, what it really boils down to is quite simple: Beer is fun. Brewing is fun. Drinking beer with your buddies is fun. So, why not a name that\u2019s fun? After all, we\u2019re in the business of helping people enjoy life. And we take our business very seriously. Our beers are craft-brewed for Old World taste and new world refreshment. Savored, slammed or sipped,these beers are also brewed to be sold and we plan on selling a lot of them. Aggressive marketing campaigns are in place to make sure Horny Goat Beers are on the radar of beer purchasers in select markets. Radio commercials, point-of-sale, guerilla tactics, swag, social media, you name it \u2018cause we plan on growing, and growing large quickly. Kind of like a horny goat.

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",

When we say we are passionate about beer, we mean REALLY passionate and this is clearly expressed in our award winning range of beers and ales. Our philosophy starts with the raw materials we use, water from The Yorkshire Dales, the finest English malted barley and hops, sourced by our brewer from all over the world. We let those simple ingredients speak for themselves and combine them with skill and patience to brew beers that are balanced, exceptional and just",

This milestone not only exemplifies their continuing commitment to amazing craft beer, but also signals a shift in focus for the brewery towards more innovative recipes and concepts.\r\n\r\nHeaded up by a small group of impassioned beer lovers including head brewer Garett Lockhart, Red Brick is determined to lead the charge in the south, putting out excellent beers such as \"Hoplanta\" IPA and the upcoming winter release \"Sacred Cow\" chai milk stout. They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects. After all, craft beer isn't just a product; it's a journey.",

                    "description": "Back when the world was a much different place, filled with grunge music, loose fitting clothes, and Wayne\u2019s World movies, two shady characters fell in together and started doing various sketch and wonderful things. One of these was brewing . . . beer. Not the tasty, modern, complex craft beers flowing in today\u2019s market, but the goofy and \u201cjust OK\u201d beers that home brewers in the 90\u2019s seemed to know how to build. These guys (we\u2019ll call them Chris and Josh for lack of anonymity\u2019s sake) got better at brewing over the years, even as they moved apart.\r\nChris went down a corporate marketing path; Josh seemed to prefer engineering and operations; both still enjoyed beer and, with lots of practice, the homebrew got better and better. When Y2K sputtered out before it even came to life, the two had their first discussion about opening a brewery. More life happened. More of the guys\u2019 improving craft beers were served at more home parties. When they got together again more recently, the topic resurfaced, but this time it wouldn\u2019t go away. And gradually a brewery was born.\r\n\r\n20 years since the start of their homebrew hobbies, Odyssey Beerwerks was formed to do the impossible: take an enjoyable hobby of creating fine craft beers and make it into a dreary job, with the benefit of bringing new and exciting hand crafted beers onto our vibrant planet.",

Introduced in 1986, Yuengling produced one of the first hand-crafted draft blends to lead this style of American brewing. Black & Tan combines our popular Dark Brewed Porter and Premium Beer to create a brew that is rich and dark in color, with a well balanced flavor that finishes smooth and satisfying. It has a faint sweetness with hints of caramel and coffee from the dark roasted malts. One sip and you'll appreciate how Yuengling raised the bar with our Original Black & Tan.",

No roast barley or strong burnt/astringent black malt character should be perceived. Medium malt, caramel and cocoa-like sweetness should be in harmony with medium-low to medium hop bitterness. This is a full bodied beer. Ale-like fruity esters should be evident but not overpowering and compliment malt derived sweetness and hop character. Hop flavor and aroma may vary from being low to medium-high. Diacetyl (butterscotch) levels should be absent.",
