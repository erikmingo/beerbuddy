My great friend, and then neighbor, Randy and I decided it was time to start brewing beer since we could not longer get our then favorite brew in the stores. Our first beer was aptly named \"Girly Beer\" and was light and refreshing.\r\n\r\nFrom there the brews continued until we were out of storage space. Our paths separated, but we each continued brewing. My brother Mike, soon took to brewing also and has been an avid brewer for many years now.\r\n\r\nBackground experience comes from homebrewing, being head brewer at Hal and Mal's in Jackson, MS, and head brewer at Riverhorse, in Lambertville, NJ.",

In the ancient bock tradition, the dark-colored brew is released in time for springtime celebrations. Bock beers are believed to have originated in the town of Einbeck, Germany and traditionally feature a goat on their labels. The term, \u201cbock\u201d occurs in several Germanic languages and roughly translates to \u201cbilly goat\u201d, but there are some unlikely alternatives. Followers of the zodiac have described it as a beer for Capricorn, the time when, as the days grow longer, brewers brew their bock beers in anticipation of the coming of spring.\r\n\r\nOver time, bock has come to mean a beer darker and stronger than a brewery's \u201cregular\u201d brew. One with, you might say, the kick of a goat behind it.",

Another says it was a bet at a card game. A third we\u2019ve been advised by our lawyers not to discuss. While each rendition may have some truth to it, what it really boils down to is quite simple: Beer is fun. Brewing is fun. Drinking beer with your buddies is fun. So, why not a name that\u2019s fun? After all, we\u2019re in the business of helping people enjoy life. And we take our business very seriously. Our beers are craft-brewed for Old World taste and new world refreshment. Savored, slammed or sipped,these beers are also brewed to be sold and we plan on selling a lot of them. Aggressive marketing campaigns are in place to make sure Horny Goat Beers are on the radar of beer purchasers in select markets. Radio commercials, point-of-sale, guerilla tactics, swag, social media, you name it \u2018cause we plan on growing, and growing large quickly. Kind of like a horny goat. So prepare yourself, the world is about to become a much hornier place.",

Malt character should be a balance of sweetness and toasted/nut-like malt; not caramel. Hop flavor should be low and hop aroma should be very low. Bocks can range in color from deep copper to dark brown. Fruity esters should be minimal. Diacetyl should be absent.",

They spent many long nights building most of the current brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipies.  More than ten years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued on a much larger scale.  In the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Recently, Ron Kutella and Chris Justema joined the parternship and what started as one brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge.",

In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.",

All of our beer is made from four basic ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and water. Our recipes use American malts, hops from Europe and America, and yeast cultured from the traditional yeast stocks found throughout the world. We do not filter our beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew over 20 styles of beer throughout the year. We offer eight beers on tap year round and we pour up to three specialty beers at any given time.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to try Altitude\u2019s microbrews and we hope you\u2019ll like them as much as we do!",

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!",

In accordance with the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law of 1516), bock beers must have a pre-fermentation malt sugar concentration of 16%, which converts over to at least 7% alcohol after fermentation. These strong beers were made popular in the early 1600s by monks in order to minimize their hunger during fasting periods. While most bocks are dark, Blonde Bock is golden-colored and malty with a rich, creamy head. The rich flavor is counterbalanced with just the right level of bitterness from the Hallertau aroma hops and create a very smooth profile.",

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

Founded as the first and still only \"Jewish-celebration beer,\"  proprietor, Jeremy Cowan, moved production to New York in 2003 and now distributes in over thirty-one U.S. states and Canada.  Shmaltz is known for blurring beer styles and using puns, art, history, and pop culture in every aspect of its products. Starting out as a contract brewer, third-party brewers produce their lineup using Shmaltz Brewing Company's proprietary recipes. In 2013, Shmaltz was \u201creborn\u201d in Clifton Park, NY, opening its own 50-barrel brewhouse in a 20,000 square foot warehouse just north of the Capitol district. Taking over 100% of their production meant bringing in the Brewmaster, Paul McErlean who designed every one of their award winning recipes, as well as Bob Craven, General Manager, and two of the experienced contract brewers. Shmaltz Brewing now has a true \"home\" for its family of fermented offerings and a tasting room for fans and curious beer lovers to come join the tribe. L'Chaim!",

Our unofficial motto is: if something is worth doing \u2013 it\u2019s worth doing well.

So Duke Maximillian I of Munich hired his own northern brewmaster, who created a lager similar in character but superior in taste. It won back the local aristocrats. Inspired by his entrepreneurial spirit we started brewing our own urBock \u2013 rich, ruby-hued beer with subtle, dark roasted flavours. It\u2019s an aristocratic beer but rest assured, you needn\u2019t be a Duke to enjoy it.",

That, in a way is what happened to Bret and Eric Kuhnhenn, two brothers who owned Lutz Hardware in Warren, MI. A Lowes warehouse opened up just a half-mile from their store, which their dad bought some 35 years ago.\r\n\r\nLike a lot of stores that have faced a similar dilemma, the Lutz owners decided they couldn\u2019t compete against big box stores. Instead of closing for good, they transformed their space into a seven-barrel microbrewery and brew-on-premise shop.\r\n\r\nIt may sound like an odd transition, but the Kuhnhenn Brothers have been in the beer business for some time. As well as being active homebrewers, they have sold homebrewing supplies out of the back of their hardware store for many years.\r\n\r\nBret Kuhnhenn says there is a long tradition of selling brewing supplies out of hardware stores. The Brothers began offering supplies out of the frustration of not being able to buy products locally.\r\n\r\nThe transition is a special one for Bret and Eric because of their love for the art of brewing. They make one of the best German-style Hefeweizens in the Detroit Metro Area as well as many other Award Winning lagers and ales. The brothers bottle their beers in 12 and 22 oz. bottles as well as offering kegs. The brew-on-premise aspect of the business is one of only a handful in the state.",

In some cases--such as with our IPA, Imperial IPA and Imperial Oatmeal Stout--we push the envelope and make a very big and flavorful brew. Put simply, we brew the beers that we like to drink! \r\n\r\nWe are located in the heart of downtown Bellingham, WA and have been dubbed \"Pure Bellingham\" by the locals!  We continually win awards for our beer, have been named one of the top 25 breweries in the U.S. (by Steve Johnson, America's Best Brews), were declared the Best Brewery in WA (by the Northwest Brewing News Reader's Poll 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010) and are the only brewery in Washington to bring home the Alpha King award for our Imperial IPA.\r\n\r\nCome have a pint with us.

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.",

As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.",

Low temperature fermentations create fewer \u201cyeasty\u201d aromas, esters, and flavors that are so common in ales.  We brew lagers because we enjoy their smooth malty and hoppy character.",

Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.  Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.",

We are a Texas family owned business founded by father and son, Ron and Rhett Keisler, along with seasoned Master Brewer and Cicerone, Grant Wood. We don't take ourselves too seriously, but we take extreme pride in our craft. We believe we can brew world-class beer in the Texas countryside. We start with fresh water from our own Trinity Aquifer well and brew our beer incorporating seasonal local ingredients. We brew on custom made equipment built for us in the U.S. by proud craftsmen. We oversee our beer to the tap to ensure you are drinking the same beer we are. We believe that our knowledge of brewing, hard work and attention to each detail is evident in every beer we craft.",

Our selection of hand crafted lagers and ales are produced on premises using the finest grains and hops. We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite. Please let Bob or Donna, or any of the High Desert Brewing Co. staff know how you think we are doing.",

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.",

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

Typically quite sweet with some roasted malt undertones, doppelbocks range in color from deep amber to nearly black and are normally associated with the winter season. Traditionally, German brewers have used the suffix \u201c-ator\u201d in naming their doppelbock beers; we have, too.\r\n\r\nS\u2019muttonator is a tasty mixture of German ingredients & good ol\u2019 fashioned New England tenaciousness. Our brewers take 30 hours to brew a single batch of this traditional Double Bock. Take your time & enjoy its rich, malty & deceptively smooth flavor.",

We started with hand selected Noble hops from Bavaria and combined them with a complex selection of carefully roasted malts. This dark beer has a big, malty character with the added sweetness of chocolate. We slowly age the beer on a bed of rare dark cocoa nibs, the primary ingredient in chocolate. Known for their quality, these cocoa nibs harvested in Ecuador, impart complex aromas and flavors from chocolaty to fruity, nutty, earthy, and citrusy.",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

Its deep, full flavor explodes with notes of maple, vanilla, oak and toffee. This flavor, along with the rich mouth feel, has drawn comparisons to a vintage port, sherry, and cognac; and Samuel Adams Triple Bock should be enjoyed in much the same way. We recommend serving it at room temperature in a snifter a few ounces at a time - one bottle should generously serve two to three.  Its warming malt character and fruit esters make it an ideal after dinner aperitif.",

High ceilings, dark grain wood, exposed brick and rich character. We highlight the history of the building without it becoming an intrusive element. Our style is simplistic and straight forward, both in atmosphere and menu. We're right in the middle of a bustling downtown that sits along a beautiful river which our large deck overlooks for an incredible outdoor dining experience in the Summer months. Or heck, a pint during a snowstorm. Our hope is to provide you with a great meal, great beer and outstanding service in a laid-back atmosphere. A mellow, all-encompassing brewpub experience.",

                    "description": "In the Early 1970's Geoffrey Scharer, a 4th generation publican of Picton visited England for the international Brew Ex-Trade Fair, where he found the inspiration to brew German Style Beers here in Australia.\r\n\r\nAgainst all odds, convinced that he could make high quality, natural beers Scharer set off about perfecting his recipes and methods. In 1981 he received the recognition he deserved in the form of the first (on Premises) brewing License ever awarded in Australia. He then set about setting up the first Pub Brewery.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Scharer opened George IV Inn in Picton where we tapped his traditional style perfected brews. This huge step paved the way for many of the fantastic craft beers now brewed and enjoyed throughout Australia today.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990\u2019s Scharer operated and lived in the Australian Hotel in The Rocks where his famed ales (Lager and Bock) were the only beers on tap. If one was to ask for a different mainstream beer, they would be told upfront \u2018we don\u2019t sell that shit here\u2019 and moved onto the next pub down the road. Geoff was a larrikin and larger than life itself.\r\n\r\nIn the early 2000\u2019s Geoff sold the pub and brewery on one condition \u2018the recipes never changed\u2019 and to this day \u2013 they haven\u2019t.\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Geoff the man known as \u2018one of the Grandfathers of Australian Craft beer\u2019 passed away in his sleep. A huge loss of one of the legends of the industry; his legacy will forever live on in his beers.",

Penn\u2019s flagship lineup features authentic German-style beers brewed in the tradition of Pittsburgh\u2019s German immigrants, according to the strict quality standards of Reinheitsgebot.  \r\nMore recently, our lineup has been expanded to include other varieties including APAs, IPAs, fruit beers, and more.  The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

Stephen was in Europe doing research in molecular biology and experienced its beer culture that lead to his mid-career crisis.  He started writing about beer, and then tried to open a brewery in Arlon, Belgium but that faltered.  He then formed the first beer-of-the-month club in Europe, Beer Around the World.  Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU.  One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere.  Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world. He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland.   One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme.  It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven.  The new company was registered in Baltimore and the new beer was eventually produced in Nagold, Germany and called in honor of Baltimore's Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Special Lager.",

Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah. There are now more than 12 thriving brew pubs in the state thanks to Schirf and the bill's sponsor, Senator Mike Demeitrick of Price, Utah.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

The use of a lager yeast and a much cooler fermentation temperature (48 \u2013 50 degrees F) is the main difference between this beer and an ale. This cooler fermentation results in a beer with less fruity flavor than an ale fermented at 65 \u2013 68 degrees F. For that authentic bock profile, To Hell n\u2019 Bock is crafted with lots of Munich malt. This grain has a toasty, bread -like aroma that imparts a delicious malty flavor to complement the fresh German hops.",

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.",

Approximately 10% of Ayinger beers are exported, mainly to Italy, the United States, and the rest of Europe. Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.",

The complex triple mash process using four types of malt gives the dark \u201cdoppelbock\u201d its characteristic malty dominance and its close to black color. The storage time of 16 weeks produces a pronounced, well-rounded taste. Despite a high original wort content, the sweetness that is frequently present with doppelbocks can scarcely be detected. The first taste is of mild fullness with an accompanying coffee tone, which becomes more dominant with the aftertaste. Between November and January you can allow yourself to be completely won over by the excellent quality of the Winterbock.",

Malt character should be a balance of sweetness and toasted/nut-like malt; not caramel. Hop flavor should be low and hop aroma should be very low. Bocks can range in color from deep copper to dark brown. Fruity esters should be minimal. Diacetyl should be absent.",
