                    "description": "We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because\u2014like today\u2014we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.  \r\n\r\nThere was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8\u00b0\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026",

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.",

It features a solid gold color with a creamy white head with solid retention leaving behind the signature Belgian lace. The aroma leans sweet with light spicy, fruity and perfumy like esters. It has a medium body with a mouth filling bubbly sensation and malty sweetness rolling over to a light hop flavor. This beer pairs well with a full range of foods like chicken, salads and fish but can pull double duty with bolder flavors from barbecue, meaty stews, steak, smoked ribs and even spicy Cajun cuisine. A portion of sales go to support the Beer Army Vigilant Guardian Foundation.",

Camusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.\r\n\r\nLocated in Chico, California, Sierra Nevada Brewing is one of the most popular craft breweries currently operating in the United States. Its Pale Ale is world renowned, and the brewery produces almost 700,000 barrels of beer per year. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.",

Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.",

Although referred to as Styrian Golding, this hop is actually genetically derived from Fuggle rather than Golding hops. At one time the less desirable Fuggles were exported to some areas as \"Fuggle Golding,\" which is probably the source of the name. This hop became the primary hop grown in Styria in the 1930s when their other landrace varieties were severely damaged by powdery mildew. Because it is genetically derived from Fuggle, it is not surprising that Styrian Goldings also resembles Fuggle in character, with a pleasant spicy aroma.",

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter\u2019s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.\r\n\r\n Having already established Margaret\u2019s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter\u2019s passion \u2013 brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He\u2019s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country\u2019s most popular brewing supply shops.\r\n\r\nWorth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret\u2019s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition \u2013 the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation\u2019s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing \u2013 perhaps one of the world\u2019s smallest craft brewers \u2013 brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.",

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.",

We consider brewing to be a craft and, whether you are brewing in your garage or on a huge production system, brewing a good beer and sharing it with others is a great way to bring together friends or even an entire community. We are proud to live in a town that is currently supporting two brewpubs and a nanobrewery, and look forward to doing our part to be a leader in the craft brewing revolution.\r\n\r\nPeople in the U.P. work hard, take great pride in what is produced locally and have answered the call in supporting and improving the local economy. The name \"Ore Dock Brewing Company\" was chosen because we see our local ore docks as grand and iconic reminders of Marquette and the U.P.'s past, present, and future identity. We hope to provide a product and establishment that our community can be proud of for many years to come!",

As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.",

The flavor is a combination of spicy Belgian yeast with hints of pear & nutmeg. It finishes with a pleasant tartness. 3rd Anniversary Ale is very light & refreshing and at the same time complex & intriguing.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the characteristic tartness in this beer, we employed a technique called Sour Mashing. This procedure allows natural bacteria to produce a small level of lactic acid prior to fermentation. The result is a complex, slightly sour treat.",

This are was a part of the Netherlands in the early 1800's and was the wheat growing region. In this era, the Dutch basically controlled the spice trade, thus, coriander as well as Curacao orange peel made its way into the beer. Spices were used well before the widespread use of hops in beer. At one point there were more than thirty breweries producing a Wit, but overtime the style died off and in 1954 the last of the breweries ceased operations. One of the most famous brands of Belgian Wits is Hoegaarden (pronounced \\Who Garden\") produced by Pierre Celis back in 1966. This revived the style and by the 1980's it was popular again!",

            "description": "This is our favorite beer to drink. We like to call it our \"LIGHT BEER\" because it is so drinkable for its size; weighing in at 10.54% ABV (Alcohol by volume). \r\nThis is a Belgian Blonde Ale, brewed with a CrAzY amount of malt and little Belgian candi syrup to give it that rich Belgian flavor. Hopped with just enough earthy Sterling hops to leave a little sweet rich malt flavor, which makes this beer go down so smooth. We work hard to get our yeast to attenuate, keeping the body down, so it seems much lighter than it really is.",

Although referred to as Styrian Golding, this hop is actually genetically derived from Fuggle rather than Golding hops. At one time the less desirable Fuggles were exported to some areas as \"Fuggle Golding,\" which is probably the source of the name. This hop became the primary hop grown in Styria in the 1930s when their other landrace varieties were severely damaged by powdery mildew. Because it is genetically derived from Fuggle, it is not surprising that Styrian Goldings also resembles Fuggle in character, with a pleasant spicy aroma.",

Blanche, meaning \u201cwhite\u201d, gets its name from the light colored haze suspended in this pale-gold brew.  The haze results from the high proportion of wheat used and from the yeast that remains in this unfiltered brew.  White beers are well known as the principal product from Hoegaarden, a small town in a wheat-growing region east of Brussels.\r\n\r\nLight, cloudy and smooth, Weyerbacher Blanche brings you authentic Belgian-style flavor along with handcrafted quality and freshness.  Just try a bottle of this thirst-quenching brew.  In the nose you\u2019ll notice a light spiciness from the coriander and dried Curacao orange peels.  Overall, you\u2019ll find a mild and refreshing 4.6% ale with a clean finish that follows with just a hint of tart spiciness.  It is available April through July.",

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.",

Light to medium body and low malt aroma with a sweet, spiced and a low to medium fruity-ester character orchestrated in flavor and aroma. Sugar may be used to lighten perceived body. They are blonde to golden in color. Noble-type hops are commonly used. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may be perceived. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Acidic character should not be present. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

This type of ale is brewed with malt  wheat and oats. It is unfiltered  which allows protein and yeast to remain suspended in the beer and creates the cloudy appearance. This also adds to the smoothness and full body of the beer.",

When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.  Please come and taste our award winning beer and fantastic food.  Food and beverages are served in our bar, dining room and lounge.  Outdoor seating is available on our spacious patio from April 1 (weather permitting) until the snow flies in winter.",

It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8\u00b0\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026",

Our brewery is situated in the former coalmining-town Roermond in Dutch Limburg and named after the patronsaint of Roermond: Saint Christoffel. The brewery started very small and was at first situated behind a house. In 1995 the brewery moved to her present facility. With moving there, the brewingcapacity greatly enhanced due to new brewing-, fermenting- and lagerfacilities. Christoffel brews according to the German Reinheitsgebot von 1516: which means the brewingprocess takes place in a completely natural way. Around the year 1990, Christoffel Blond was awarded 3 years in a row with the Dutch title: Best Beer from the Netherlands.",

And then prohibition shut it down. Re-established in 2007, we are honored to say that four months and four beers in, Mission was awarded two national medals at the Great American Beer Festival. Fast forward to 2010 our plunder of precious beer medals has gown considerably. Three Gold, three Silver and two Bronze medals now fill our bounty. A dream come true for long-time die-hard home brewers. From modest beginnings to a state of the art custom made brewery in the historic Wonderbread building just east of San Diego\u2019s baseball stadium Petco Park. Our brewery should be brewing beer with in the month. Soon therafter our tasting bar will be open to the public. There\u2019s nothing more enjoyable than a pint while watching the beer you\u2019re drinking being made a few feet from where you\u2019re sitting.\r\nNo catchy gimmicks. No national campaigns. Just great handcrafted beer made in San Diego!",

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado.

We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",

                    "description": "COOP Ale Works began with a humble home brewer and a simple dream. The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own. Thank you for your unwavering support and encouragement!",

As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.",

Easton blonde has a slight sweetness to it, but is dominated by the peppery and phenolic notes that are typical of Belgian style yeasts.  These notes are complemented by the spicy hop aroma and flavor offered by noble hops. We added some sugar to the brew (which is standard) allowing for an increase in alcohol compared to our other beers, but retaining a dryness that allows for drink-ability.  The slight (at about 6% ABV) alcohol warming also increases the perception of the spicy, dry, phenolic character that defines the style.",

                    "description": "All families have their stories: tales of grandparents and great-grandparents and the incredible things they accomplished, or lived through, or overcame. My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing",

For the first summer the Event Center kept the main floor as a stage and dance floor. For the first summer we offered four beers:  Estes Park Porter, Estes Park Renegade, Longs Peak Raspberry Wheat and Estes Park Pale Ale.  In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot. Since '95 we've continued to evolve both in our restaurant and with our brewing operations. In 2003 Tyler Lemirande and Eric Bratrud took over as owners.",

In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.",

From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.\r\n\r\nGypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013. Some of our first batches might be a crisp, spicy rye abbey ale, a rich, golden Belgian tripel, and a hop-focused pale ale made with clean, slightly acidic champagne yeast.",

The other half of it is right here. The power of the internet, social media, and networking is here to see. Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.",

Based on traditional Belgian farmhouse architecture and set on a former hop farm in upstate New York, Brewery Ommegang was born with the philosophy that truly unique ales must be built from the ground up. Now brewing six award-winning Belgian-style ales, an imaginative range of seasonal and limited edition ales, and offering daily tours and tastings, plus a full calendar of special events, Brewery Ommegang is the place where brewing is an art and partaking is a passion.",

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures of hand crafted beers and life in the Queen City finally merged into this moment in time and allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a uniquely Charlotte experience.",

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.",

Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

It was there that John J. first discovered the lingonberry, a tart cousin of the cranberry that originally calls the Scandinavian region home. Inspired by this discovery, the brewers decided to pay homage to the region that brought them this berry by introducing another Scandinavian staple, the hearty spruce tree.\r\n\r\nGran Gas, literally translated 'Spruce Goose' in Swedish, was brewed with 220 pounds of hand-picked spruce tips from Colorado, giving the beer a strong piney aroma with a hint of melon. The herbal character of the fresh spruce tips are complemented by the addition of a spicy Belgian yeast.\r\n\r\nA secondary fermentation with the lingon berries contrasts that spiciness and gives the beer its beautiful reddish-honey hue in a body that finishes tart and slightly sweet. With influences and ingredients from all over the globe, Gran Gas is truly an international drinking experience.",

The taproom will have dartboards, a comfy lounge, and a few TVs for those days when the game is on. \r\n\r\nOur beer will also be available to the public. Ask for it at your local watering hole! \r\n\r\nAt Raleigh Brewing Company we intend to be a big part of the local Raleigh community. We plan to do that by staying as green as possible by reclaiming our water used to brew with, recycling, and conserving energy, donating money/beer/time to local charities, and opening up our space for local groups/organizations/events as much as possible. If there's anything you'd like to see us do, just shoot us an email! \r\n\r\nWe look forward to opening our doors and serving you some hand-crafted beers, which will hopefully be at the very beginning of 2013! \r\n\r\nCheers!",

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)",

In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager.\r\nLuc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia.\r\nLuc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on \u2018old Flemish brown\u2019, Bacchus.\r\nIn 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.\r\nIn 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer\u2019s uprising against French occupation in 1798.\r\nIn 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched. It starts with \u2018Donker\u2019, than \u2018Tripel\u2019, \u2018Rouge\u2019 and \u2018Blond\u2019.\r\nIn 2009, the 5th generation, Xavier Van Honsebrouck, takes over.\r\nHis first achievement is the \u2018Cuv\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau\u2019.\r\nIn 2012 the high exclusive Trignac follows and in 2013 Kasteel Hoppy.\r\nIn commemoration of a 100 years World War I, \u2018Passchendaele\u2019, a Belgian Top Blond, with only 5.2\u00b0 alcohol is launched in 2013. A donation is offered to the community of Zonnebeke, to contribute in the preservation of its remnants of the Great War.\r\nDue to the fast growing export, the actual brewery is almost on its full capacity. A delocalisation to a brand new castle/brewery is scheduled for 2017.",

Despite this goal, the brewery was run as a commercial enterprise. The abbey owned several bars in the area and produced lager under its own \"Trappist\" brand as well as contract brewing for several private labels. In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel. The brewery also produces the world's only Trappist witbier. The brewery also used to produce the Jopen beer.",

From that conversation forward there would be no looking back. A business plan was developed and hundreds of test batches brewed. In 2011 Walt and Luke\u2019s lifelong friend Ryan Guthy and his parents Rick and Denise all sat down at their house in the mountains of Western North Carolina to taste some of Luke and Walt\u2019s creations while looking over the plans for what would be Wicked Weed Brewing.  After being thoroughly impressed with the full flavor and vision of the project, the Guthys joined the Dickinsons and the team was assembled.  Over the next months Wicked Weed Brewing found a home at 91 Biltmore avenue, a building that seemed destined to be a brewery.\r\nWith the creativity of Luke, vision of Walt, dedication of Ryan, exquisite taste of Denise and wisdom of Rick a truly unique brewery was born.  So from the humble beginning of a basement, the dream of Wicked Weed Brewing has come to life. Our beer is bold, full of excitement and flavor.  Always focused on drinkability and pushing the boundaries of what we think we are capable of.  Wicked Weed Brewing will always evolve, always grow and always aspire to be greater.  Join us in bringing something a little Wicked to Asheville.",

The microbrewery is located in a 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) factory in in Red Hook, Brooklyn that formerly manufactured filing cabinets. Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.  Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.",

The moon projected its reddish glow on Saint Rumbold\u2019s tower, which was wrapped in a dense fog. \u201cFire, fire, the tower is on fire!\u201d shouts the dreary voice of a drunken man. The alarm was sounded and people were making haste to help extinguish the so-called fire. Before the tower was reached, the moon slowly moved through the fog. From that moment on, the Mechelenians are called the Maneblussers or \u201cMoon extinguishers\u201d. To commemorate their heroic deed, we brew a heroic beer called The Maneblusser. A blonde beer with an alcohol percentage of 6 % VOL. Brewed according to the traditional method of high fermentation with refermentation in the bottle.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

Despite this goal, the brewery was run as a commercial enterprise. The abbey owned several bars in the area and produced lager under its own \"Trappist\" brand as well as contract brewing for several private labels. In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with Dubbel and Tripel in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced Blond. Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called Enkel. The brewery also produces the world's only Trappist witbier. The brewery also used to produce the Jopen beer.",

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.",

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

The pale wood of the glass holder makes a pleasant contrast with the beer.\r\n\r\nYou will smell a mellow, fruity and malty aroma with a slightly spicy character (coriander, hops). Additional earthy and very subtle aromas of banana and perhaps also a whiff of pineapple or mango in the background.\r\n\r\nDiscover a very mellow, fruity attack, a nougat-like solidity, and a slightly spicy character with hints of liquorice passing into a warm finish that reminds you of caramelised banana. The bitterness always remains in the background but in the end emerges delicately.",

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!",

In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.",

We believe quality beers require quality ingredients and a painstaking attention to detail throughout the brewing process.  \r\n\r\nAdelbert\u2019s uses Bohemian old-world floor malted barley, low alpha Noble Czech hops, and fresh yeast propagated at the brewery. In our seven vessel brewhouse, we use a time consuming, multi-temperature decoction mash technique which extracts a more complex flavor from our grains.\r\n\r\nWe produce a gambit of hand-crafted Belgian style ales right here in Austin, Texas. With our vast array of beer styles, you're sure to find a brew that suits you.\r\n \r\nOur Belgian-Style Ales include:\r\nRambler Blonde\r\nNaked Nun Wit\r\nBlack Rhino Black Ale\r\nScratchin' Hippo Biere de Garde\r\nPhilosophizer Saison\r\nDancin' Monks Dubbel Ale\r\nTripel B Tripel Ale\r\nFlyin' Monks Quadrupel Ale\r\n \r\nAlso, look for our Barrel-Aged \"Vintage Series\" where we age one of our eight ales in oak barrels for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough our selection of beer is great to enjoy by itself; each of them also pair perfectly with just about any food. From spicy Thai food to a backyard barbecue with ribs and brisket, to a formal dinner with steak or seafood and a dark chocolate dessert; our artisanal Belgian-style ales go with pretty much everything. Please share pictures and recipes that you've either used our beer to cook with or have enjoyed right alongside them!",

Back when life was freer and easier, the local cream ale was no stranger inside the Rambler as it hosted myriad road trips and hot dates. \r\n\r\nThis blonde ale has a subtle honey nose with hints of earthy hops. Subtle and lightly sweet at the start, this ale finishes dry with subtle spice notes. Its smoothness makes it ideal for drinking with a variety of foods.",

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness.

From humble beginnings, brewing 800 barrels of three different beers in 1994, we have progressed to brewing 13,000 barrels of twenty different beers in 2007. We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.",

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.",

Or you could be social and get out to your favorite local watering hole. If they don't have our beer on tap, let us know and we'll do our best to pester 'em into submission. Do we bottle? Not yet but we never say never. Right now we're focused on doing one thing right... draft beer. Cheers!",

                    "description": "Eastern Shore Brewing opened it's doors September of 2008 by owners Adrian and Lori Moritz.  Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....",

We were finance geeks living in a world without soul.  Grinding it out everyday for a fee, wearing suits and kissing butt.\r\n\r\nThen this brewery chose us...she forced us to ask ourselves, \"Is this desk job really how I pictured my life?\"  We answered that questions by taking over River Horse in 2007 and have not looked back.  We may not end up as the greatest success story on earth, but at least we had the balls to try.  Sometimes, for better or worse, your dreams get the best of you.\r\n\r\nJust remember, it's a big world out there and cubicles don't have doors, so you can walk out anytime.  Come see us when you can.  We are located in Lambertville, NJ on the banks of the Delaware.  Thanks for supporting the cause.  Hope you enjoy the beer...",

The brewery and its beers are usually referred to as Westvleteren. The brewery's three beers have acquired an international reputation for taste and quality, being considered by a percentage of beer aficionados and judges to be \"the best beer in the world\" (for Wesvleteren XII, a Quadrupel) as well as the limited availability of the beers which are not brewed to normal commercial demands, but are sold in small quantities weekly from the doors of the monastery itself, to individual buyers after reservation only.",

The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of professionals that could brew his recipe.\r\n\r\nHis journey ended when he found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called \u201cDe Proefbrouwerij\u201d. There Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.\r\n\r\nSince then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the time was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA. These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible to a wider audience of beer lovers.",

Like the history of brewing in Philadelphia the name Philadelphia Brewing Company has gone through many revivals. The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!",

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.",

Now brewing six award-winning Belgian-style ales, an imaginative range of seasonal and limited edition ales, and offering daily tours and tastings, plus a full calendar of special events, Brewery Ommegang is the place where brewing is an art and partaking is a passion.",
