The first to make the world's best beer and the second to share with people near and far the fascinating culture and heritage of the Cigar City of Tampa. From its past as the world's largest cigar producer to its Latin roots and the many other diverse peoples that call it home, Tampa draws on many sources to develop its unique culture. At CCB we are fascinated by Tampa's history and suspect you will be too.",

We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window.

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!",

            "description": "Brewed on the same morning as the astrological phenomenon, Blood Moon is a collaboration beer brewed with Tom Peters of the famous Monk\u2019s Caf\u00e9 in Philadelphia, PA.  Tom brews from time to time with some of the best brewers in the world and has been a long-time friend and supporter of Sam and Dogfish Head, so when he approached us to brew a special beer we were happy to oblige.  Blood Moon is a smokey strong ale brewed with a touch of special Fuji Apple Wood smoked malt as well as some rye, and a kiss of molasses to lighten the body while adding complexity to the flavor.  Brewed with several European and American hop varieties for just enough bitterness to balance out the malt, Blood Moon has many nuances that change with each sip as the beer warms.  This beer is a divine pairing with any of our Woodgrilled offerings, the smoked malt acting as a perfect complement to the charred notes of our burgers and Steak.\r\n- See more at: http://www.dogfish.com/node/421131#sthash.YOFLfPS3.dpuf",

For the next few days, until all of our facilities are complete, operations will be limited. We will be pouring pints of all of our regular beers along with one limited release offering; payments will be cash only until our credit card machine is operational. In the next few weeks we will be adding four additional taps and will start filling 32 ounce and 1 gallon growlers to take home.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

When Kemper's closed its doors, he decided to follow his passion and strike out on his own.\r\n \r\nDistribution of Hood Canal Beers started in Kitsap County. He later expanded his sales to the Seattle area via Odom Distributing Corporation, and now he personally distributes to bars, pubs, and grocery stores in Kitsap and surrounding counties.\r\n \r\nOur Tasting Room is on Bond Road between Kingston and Poulsbo.

While home brewing late one evening, the three Cs had a crazy idea to start a brewery. All of our hard work is finally paying off and we anticipate an early summer 2012 opening of our South End microbrewery! We can't wait to share our beer with Charlotte and beyond and look forward welcoming everyone to our spacious tap room very soon.",

We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window.

An additional layer of complexity is added to Jester King\u2019s bottled beers by allowing a second fermentation to take place in the bottle. As part of its commitment to sustainability, the slow food movement and Texas, Jester King beer uses as many organic and local ingredients as possible and will soon be brewed with harvested rainwater.",

We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window.

Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.",

Post on the wall, check out our polls, suggest a flavor and give us a challenge: we love brews that are out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\n1. Create great craft beer that is unapologetically Houston.\r\n\r\nJust like our great city, we celebrate the individuality and unique flavors of each brew. We use top-notch ingredients and brew beer that makes us proud. \r\n\r\n2. Bring great people together around great beer.\r\n\r\nThis beer has soul. During our tastings, great things happen. Strangers geek out together over flavor theory. Palates evolve at light speed. We got a little tipsy. In the end, we make new friends and have a good time. And that\u2019s what Houston means to us.",

Chris and Chris met while working at a local bank and quickly realized we weren't cut out for banking and dreamed of owning our own business. While home brewing late one evening, the three Cs had a crazy idea to start a brewery. All of our hard work is finally paying off and we anticipate an early summer 2012 opening of our South End microbrewery! We can't wait to share our beer with Charlotte and beyond and look forward welcoming everyone to our spacious tap room very soon.",

Named after the city where it was brewed, it is sometimes known as Gratzer (the name the Germans gave the city of Grodziskie when they took over). This style was popular across much of Poland and northern Germany during the 19th Century and into the 20th up to the first World War. Thought to have been born sometime in the 14th Century, this beer style disappeared in the 1990s when the last brewery in Poland producing it closed.\r\n\r\nVlad the Inhaler is brewed with 99% wheat, 1% malted barley (Munich) is used to satisfy TTB regulations. (The official Federal definition of beer requires barley.) The wheat and barley is smoked at the brewery over oak for two hours prior to mashing.",
