Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

A nice crisp refreshing golden ale. I was really enjoying wheat beers at the time. I guess that's why I let him start Rock Art! The Brewery was ready to leave home and move to it's own place down the road in Morrisville, VT in 2001. We are still located there and now have a terrific space for people to come and visit.

Slice some eggplant about \u00be of an inch and put some nice diamond grill marks on both sides. On the side mix up a baby greens salad with a little mescaline mix, spinach leaves, thin sliced carrots, a few cherry tomatoes sprinkle with a balsamic vinaigrette, a few capers and a little fresh grated parmesan cheese.",

That\u2019s why we teamed up with our friends at Northbound Smokehouse Brewpub in South Minneapolis to bring you Hot Box Imperial Smoked Pepper Porter. This collaboration beer is brewed with hickory-smoked peppers and malt cold-smoked over alder, maple and apple woods. Sweet and smoky, with hints of dark fruit and coffee, Hot Box provides just enough heat to keep you thawed during the coldest winter months. This beer may not be for everyone, but then again, neither are Minnesota winters!",

Huber Brewing Company was set in motion in 1984 with the dreams of Missouri farmboy John Huber as he tasted his first home-brewed beer. In 2003, John received a home-brew kit for Christmas from his wife and sons. It was at that moment the Huber Brew or \"Hubrew\", the Company's flagship beer, was born. In 2009, he opened up Homebrew Supply of Southeast Missouri, LLC in Jackson, Missouri. In 2011, the John A. Huber Brewing Company took root in Fruitland, Missouri. The Company is a family owned and operated business. John's sons, Matthew and Chad, assist their father in the Company's operation. John and his family have lived in Southeast Missouri all their lives. They want to share their passion for brewing, their sense of community and their comradery. Come join them.\"\r\n\r\nHubrew is a packaging brewery. We do not currently have any onsite sales or tours.",

A nice crisp refreshing golden ale. I was really enjoying wheat beers at the time. I guess that's why I let him start Rock Art! The Brewery was ready to leave home and move to it's own place down the road in Morrisville, VT in 2001. We are still located there and now have a terrific space for people to come and visit. Come on by and say hello!\r\n\r\nOur Mission is to offer our friends and family a wonderful beer at the end of the day!",

By brewing in small batches, we can ensure that a few old favorites are always on tap, but new goodies greet visitors each month.\r\n\r\nOur brewery is founded on passion for high quality, flavorfully crafted beer and the belief that the best pints are those shared with good company.

He has traveled as far as Wisconsin to obtain equipment for his two barrel brewhouse. He is excited to finally put down the hammer and dedicate his full attention to commercially brewing his fine-tuned recipes. Bill, who firmly believes a local, family business offers the best service and product, is proud to have a family-run business operated by only him and his girlfriend. His product is hand-bottled and labeled. As of now, the beer is available in Franklin County, MA, with a wider distribution area in the future. Lefty creates high quality beers using only the finest quality ingredients available. He focuses on the simple pleasures of the traditional and time-tested European brewing techniques. Lefty looks forward to sharing 6 year-round beers, with seasonal and specialty batches offered throughout the year.",

The malts are smoked using apple and hickory wood for a full 72 hours. Spring House Brewing Co. chose to smoke the grain in a local smoke house that dates back to the late 19th century. This one-of-a-kind smoke house imparts layers of smoky depth to the beer that cannot be replicated. Enjoy!",

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

Both had put together plans for their company vision and, as luck would have it, those plans mirrored each other!  The two joined forces and Quest Brewing Company was founded.\r\n\r\nOnce the business was formed, a brewery name was needed.  After weeks of brainstorming, the name \u2018Quest\u2019 rose to the top of our list.  We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.\r\n\r\n\u201dPeople in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.  Whether it is to bike the entire Swamp Rabbit Trail or hike Table Rock, there is a very adventurous spirit here.  We wanted to embrace that.\u201d -Quest\u2019s Andrew Watts\r\n\r\nQuest\u2019s beer is meant to be premium and sought-after, much like a goal or quest.  The next time you are in Greenville, make it your quest to visit all our town has to offer.  Head to Falls Park.  Enjoy Main Street.  Most importantly, enjoy one of Quest\u2019s hand-crafted beers!",

It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town\u2019s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn\u2019t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too! Trust us; it really isn't as crazy as it sounds.",

This Porter is a stronger, smoked version of our flagship Porter.  It is dark brown, almost black in color, and has a smoky, roasted  aroma and smooth, rich, complex smoke and chocolate flavors. Our Brewers and the Tasting Room crew teamed up to mill in by hand 5000 pounds of German beech wood smoked malt and  600 pounds of roasted malt. This was all done bag by bag over the course of an afternoon, truly a labor of love!",

Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.  Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.",

                "description": "Smoke porters are chestnut brown to black in color. They can exhibit a mild to assertive smoke character in balance with other beer characters. Black malt character can be perceived in some porters, while others may be absent of strong roast character. Roast barley character should be absent. Medium to full malt sweetness, caramel and chocolate are acceptable along with medium to medium-high hop bitterness. These beers are usually medium to full bodied. Fruity esters are acceptable. Hop flavor and aroma may vary from being negligible to medium in character.",
