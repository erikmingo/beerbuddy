Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.\r\n\r\nToday, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!",
