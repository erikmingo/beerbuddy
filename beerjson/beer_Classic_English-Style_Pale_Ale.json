It is brewed with pale ale and pale crystal malted barley and hopped with Nelson Sauvin.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand Pale Ale is the latest in our World Beers series. We first used Nelson Sauvin hops in our Celebratory Ale, William Godell, in 2009. We love the green citrus aromas that this hop provides.\r\n\r\nThis hop variety is grown on New Zealand\u2019s South Island and it adds fantastic gooseberry flavours to the beer similar to a Sauvignon Blanc. New Zealand has been producing some fantastic hop varieties for many years but the aroma of Nelson Sauvin is truly unique in the hop world.\u201d",

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz\u2019s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.",

Started by military veterans Brian Evitts (U.S. Navy), and Mike Ratkowski (U.S. Army). They met as managers of the same company and were drawn together by the same home brewing passion to make excellent beers. Brian has been an avid home brewer for almost 15 years, while Mike has always enjoyed the culture of breweries. They both felt there was a lack of their style of beer--beer focused on the malted barley and not so focused on the hops.\r\n\r\nRailhouse Brewery currently offers seasonal and year-round beers, including the following: Mastiff Oatmeal Stout, KA-BAR Brown Ale, FCA IPA, Vanilla Porter, Barleywine, and Pale Ale. The brewery and pub is located at 105 East South Street, Aberdeen, NC.",

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!",

Medium to high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable, though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels.",

A few years ago we had an opportunity that would allow us to open up our own brewery. We jumped on it.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re extremely excited about this project, and we think it shows in everything we do. This is just plain fun for us. The day it starts to feel like a job is the day when lightning shall strike us dead. Cause, hey, at the end of the day we're making beer. And beer is fun.\r\n\r\nJoin us, it should be a kick ass ride with some cool stops along the way!",

All the ales have nautical themed names to gel with the surroundings in which it is brewed\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003 the brewery was bought and renamed the Nelson Brewing Company to fall in line with the most famous naval hero of all time 'Admiral Horatio Nelson' and that his flagship 'The Victory' was built here in Chatham Dockyard.\r\n\r\nIn July 2006 the brewery was purchased by Piers Macdonald. Piers has over 20 years experience in the brewing industry and is passionate to keep the traditions of Kent brewing alive. Using the best ingredients and the finest Kent hops, combined with the expertise and dedication of his brewing staff, Piers plans to build on the brewery's already growing reputation as the provider of some of the tastiest ales on the market.\r\n\r\nNow brewing from a seven and a half barrel kit and regularly having over a dozen ales of various strengths and taste available, the brewery is sure to have a beer to suit all!",

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.",

The beer itself is deep amber in colour with a blend of pale ale and crystal malt. The bitterness and fruity aroma are developed from a combination of hops.",

Well, I guess Yukoners have been doing it for many years before we showed up, but this Olde English Ale has to make the whole thing a little more bearable.\r\n\r\nThis brew is not for the faint of heart; it doesn\u2019t leap out and bite you (most Lead Dogs are better trained than that), but it will most certainly sneak up and knock you for a loop if given the chance (this character might be more comparable to that of the Malamute and Husky!).\r\n\r\nBrewed to be high test, 7% alcohol by volume, the beer nonetheless drinks very smooth; the product of a careful blend of six different malts, and 2 months of aging after fermentation. The dark chocolate appearance is reminiscent of a porter, and the slightly darkened creamy head tops the look. But the first sip lets you know that this beer can be consumed, in quantity if desired (or required?), without leading to an overly full gullet.\r\n\r\nIntricate malt flavours predominate, with a medium mouth-feel and a very light bitter. This ale promises to take the chill off after running the team in the crisp January nights.",

Note that \"earthy, herbal English-variety hop character\" is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Medium to high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable, though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels.",

Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.",

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.",

                    "description": "Furthermore bought a building way back in 2005 with the hopes of shoe-stringing together an undersized, Frankenstein-style brewery. The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.",

APT and its festive, open-air venue have inspired us to craft an elegant, light-bodied and \"proper\" English Ale. At 12\u00b0 Plato, the Proper is fairly light, with subtle toasty notes and a slight sweetness garnered from a touch of Munich and Caramel Malts. 15.5 IBUs (bitterness units) is enough to sharpen the mouthfeel without coming across as bitter. The hop bill is at its core, English\u2014Kent Golding being the dominant player but we've employed \u201cBrewer's License\u201d and thrown in some very non-English Tettnang hops\u2014because it tastes good.

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

            "description": "Always a crowd pleaser, our version of the ever popular Pale Ale leans more towards an English Bitter than the everyday American Pale Ale. Earthy on the nose with a light floral background, this brew has a lingering caramel malt flavor and a splash of fresh citrus. The chosen yeast strain provides a distinctly European feel, but our hop profile remains uniquely American in delivering the expected flavor and aroma, as well as a characteristic bitter edge. It is hop-forward with a balance towards late hop additions and bitterness, yet this medium-bodied brew maintains an ample malt foundation on the way to a smooth, refreshing finish.",

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

Iron Swan pours a deep copper color and has an enticing intro of fruit and caramel with subtle hints of earth and spice. This medium bodied ale showcases the fruitiness of our house ale strain, along with the rich toffee flavors of English crystal malt. Added complexity is provided by generous amounts of English hops. Iron Swan finishes slightly dry with a mild spiciness that beckons another can. Fire up your turntable and audition Iron Swan yourself.",

Owners Alan and Bob conceived their idea like many Yukon babies \u2013 around a campfire on a canoe trip. Both Ontario natives, they\u2019ve lived and worked in the Territory for a good deal of their adult lives.\r\n\r\nFrom that inaugural conversation grew plans for a craft brewery that would service the north with quality beer while keeping jobs and money in the territory.\r\n\r\nOver a decade later Yukon Brewing, as it is called today, continues to work towards that goal. Employing a dozen or so staff (more in the busy summer months), Yukon Brewing actively supports countless Yukon events and causes each year.\r\n\r\nBob and Alan continue as owners and chief operators, growing the company outside the Yukon. The breweries 8 packaged beers are available across Alberta and BC with some even finding their way as far east as Quebec and at the Hannover Zoo in Germany.",

            "description": "The Yukon\u2019s number one selling draught (yes, including the mega-breweries), this ale was designed to be an almost \u201cnon-ale\u201d. It is golden in colour, brilliantly clear, and clean across the palate. The mix of 5 malts still provides subtle character in the body, and the addition of malted wheat provides a slight, but characteristic citrusy finish.\r\n\r\nHopped with noble Saaz, Sterling and UK Golding, the bitter is barely perceptible, but mild hop flavours linger in the after-taste; the dry, clean finish provides a refreshing perk at the back of the palate. The full package mimics the classic milds of the British Isles, with a bit of Yukon spirit, just to make sure you remember what part of the world it\u2019s from!\r\n\r\nThe artwork on the package and label was created by Artist Lynn Blakie. Her piece captured the gold that\u2019s present not only in the soils of the Klondike but in the spirit of the north. Gold is in the colours and culture of this place, the campfires and the ever-lasting summer sun.",
