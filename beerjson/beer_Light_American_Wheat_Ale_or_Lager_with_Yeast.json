                    "description": "We started the Harpoon Brewery in 1986 because\u2014like today\u2014we loved beer and wanted more quality choices.  \r\n\r\nThere was only one problem: we were beer lovers, not brewers. We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

The challenge was to take our combined skills and create a brewpub that excels in providing tasty beers, inspired food, and excellent customer service.  After meeting in college, the group entered the work place to refine the skills required to create and operate a successful brewpub.  In January of 2010, with inspired council from family, Paul Coggins relocated to Georgia to focus the group on one purpose.  With the help of God, the group was charged to create the best dining experience for the community.  After many months of construction, permitting, setbacks, and discoveries; Toasted and Tapped opened its doors to the public on November 26th, 2010.  We at Toasted and Tapped are excited to offer the best food, beer, and service we can to the community which gives us so much.",

                    "description": "Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Many waterfowl follow the river on their migratory flights and they seemingly spend quite a lot of time circling in this area, as if confused over this natural phenomenon. Thus the name \"The Lost Duck Brewing Company\" was born. Take a tour of our website to find the current brews available, our pub-style foods and the events happening at the Duck.",

Because of its recent origin, it is not clear how it will develop in large scale commercial production; the numbers given are based on a few early crops. Summit has strong orange/tangerine citrus notes in aroma and flavor and its growers also suggest it as a good candidate for dry hopping. It was also the featured hop used in every beer in the 2006 Single Hop Festival hosted by Drake's Brewing Company.",

The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Our mission was to make beer that called to mind three things: quality, purity, and sanity.\r\n\r\nThat's why we make our ales using only natural ingredients. You will find us on draught and in bottles at fabulous bars and restaurants throughout the state as well as in six packs at your favorite liquor store. So, if you\r\nshould get your hands on a Bristol beer, know that it was brewed fresh no more than a few hours from where you're sitting.\r\n\r\nWe take extra care to make our beers better because we like to drink them. We hope you will, too.",

That first restaurant was called the Ram Pub, which was a \u201cDeluxe Tavern\u201d that served hot food, including cook-your-own burgers and steaks, along with beer and wine.\r\n\r\nSince 1971, the Ram\u2019s primary commitment has been to always provide our guests with superior quality food and gracious hospitality.

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner. Although the traditional name for this hop would be Saazer (or Saaz Saazer when grown in the Saaz area), it is generally simply referred to as Saaz or Czech Saaz. zech Saaz is grown not only in ?atec area but also in Tr?ice area (Central Moravia) and ?st? n/L area (North Bohemia). Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American). True Saaz Saazer hops are prized for their mild, pleasant flavor, and are the only choice for brewing an authentic Pilsner.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

Agave nectar is a natural sweetener similar to honey, but with a nuttier taste.

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment. That's just how we do business.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the Ebel brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including a line of oak aged ales. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. Two Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.\r\n\r\nA whole family of great beer",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

Island Wheat captures all of the classical elements of this style, while adding its own twist to the mix.\r\n\r\nWheat used in this brew is grown on Wisconsin's own Washington Island (off the tip of famous Door County). Lake Michigan creates a maritime climate on the Island, giving the wheat crop very unique characteristics that carry through to the personality of the beer.\r\n\r\nWhen you enjoy your first Island Wheat, you will notice that it has a hazy, golden hue and a dense, rocky head. This beer is one of those rare brews that a wide variety of beer drinkers will enjoy. Those that find lighter beer appealing will find the refreshing mildness to their liking. While those that enjoy a more robust brew will find the complexity of the wheats used more than satisfying.",

All of our beer is produced in small batches for local distribution to ensure that you get the freshest beer possible.\r\n\r\nPurity is one of our top priorities. We use only four ingredients in our beer, malted barley, hops, yeast and water. Our beer does not contain chemicals or additives of any kind and it is not pasteurized.\r\n\r\nOur method of brewing is time consuming and our choice of ingredients is expensive.

Tom\u2019s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete\u2019s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer \u2013 and specifically micro-brews \u2013 have contributed to Tom\u2019s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.) Currently he is a big fan of Elysian and Russian River Brewing, and these companies have influenced his brewing style which he calls \u201caggressive California-style ales, with a Northwest twist, using fresh Northwest ingredients\u201d.",

Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia. Thanks for your support!",

The Brewery is located in just outside of Laurelton PA. We are a small production brewery using a one barrel brewing system. We hope to produce around 50 barrels a year. At present we are making 4 different styles of beer. A Wheat beer, Porter, Grand Cru, and Belgian Dubbel. All of our beer is unfiltered, and bottle conditioned. Our beers are now available at the Bull Run Inn, Market St., Lewisburg, The Beer Barn, Lewisburg and Wehr's Beverages, Mifflinburg.",

                    "description": "Is it a family restaurant, or a world-renowned brewery? Flossmoor Station has no identity crisis \u2014 it carries both titles with panache! Named \u201cBest Brewery in Chicago\u201d by Chicago Magazine (August 2002), Flossmoor Station features a gleaming glass-enclosed brewery where guests can watch how its fine handcrafted beers are made. (Tours are available upon request). The brewery has won dozens of local, national and international brewing industry honors in only ten years \u2013 a distinction not lost on micro-brew aficionados. \r\n\r\nSome of its more notable awards include being named Best Small Brewpub and Best Small Brewpub Brewer in America at the 2006 Great American Beer FestivalTM and winning gold, silver and bronze medals. Gold and silver medals were also awarded at the 2006 World Beer Cup. In addition, Flossmoor Station Brewery consistently receives top honors and recognition from the Real Ale Festival, Festival of Barrel Aged Beers and the Chicago Beer Society.\r\n\r\nProduced entirely on-site, Flossmoor Station Brewing Company\u2019s beers are handcrafted from the finest ingredients available, brewed in small batches with close attention to detail, and transferred to storage tanks in Flossmoor Station\u2019s beer cellar until its flavor is at its peak. When a customer orders a pint of beer \r\nupstairs at the massive oak bar, that lucky patron is assured of getting the freshest pint of brew money can buy. \r\n\r\nEight different beers round out the selection of \u201cThe Great Eight House Beers\u201d which are offered on a regular basis at Flossmoor Station. In addition, beer enthusiasts look forward to the \u201cBrewmaster\u2019s Specials\u201d which are offered in limited batches, including some seasonal favorites. Many of the brewery\u2019s awards have gone to these more unique concoctions which have stood up to the best beers in the world at international competitions.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The Blind Tiger Brewery was named after the Prohibition-era custom of displaying stuffed tigers to alert patrons to speakeasies or the availability of alcohol. True to our name, we serve handcrafted beers, all of which we brew here locally. The Blind Tiger Brewery is, in itself, a huge establishment, with an incredible multi-level interior. Seating capacity rests at 300 on eight different levels, including an outdoor deck. Our unique lighting, and rich decorated cedar interior creates an ambience for everyone to enjoy. Our own special bar and lounge offers full menu service with seating for 150. You can catch your favorite sporting event on one of 18 televisions or on our HUGE 8' x 10' projection screen TV.  For those who are first time visitors to our brewery, check out the memorabilia that covers the walls \u2013 national and local celebrities and events!",

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

                    "description": "When Gene Muller founded Flying Fish Brewing Co. in 1995, he did so first on the World Wide Web - making it the world's first virtual microbrewery. That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Freestyle is the taste of summer in Texas.\r\n\r\nBrewed with the finest American Two-Row and American white wheat, Freestyle has a crisp, dry flavor followed by a slightly sweet malt finish. It\u2019s light and refreshing, like a pilsner brewed as an ale. This could also be called a blonde ale, but since it plays fast and loose with classic beer categories, we call it Freestyle.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

Our signature brews represent a sophisticated array of styles perfected over many years, with a few unique twists. Ben has refined each recipe and sourced the highest quality ingredients for every batch of specially crafted Fat Bottom beer.\r\n\r\nOur beer is unfiltered, so you can savor the unique cloudy appearance and subtle flavors that truly bring craft beer to life. We like the bolder hops flavors, distinct body of aromas, and the beautiful color compounds that come from the natural grains. Unfiltered beers also have more nutrients from yeast and barley malt, including B vitamins which have been shown to reduce the effects of hangovers\u2026 a little added benefit for those of us who seriously love beer.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

            "description": "We originally brewed Halcyon as our first summer seasonal, but since all the Halcyon fans (a.k.a: kiteheads) asked so nicely, we now brew this magical brew year around. Besides, who doesn't want a little taste of summer on a dark winter night?\r\n\r\nWe are proud of all our beers, but Halcyon is special. We are in \u201cthe wheat state\u201d after all, so the pressure was on us to make a wheat beer, but we knew it had to be great. Halcyon Unfiltered Wheat is the result of that Midwestern angst, an all-American wheat with real Kansas-grown grain in the brew.\r\n\r\nWe start with raw Kansas white wheat in the mix to give it a nice edge, but what really makes it shine is the hops. We use \u201chop-bursting\u201d late in the brewing process and this gives Halcyon its palate of tropical fruit flavors & aromas with a bright and refreshing taste like the best days of summer.\r\n\r\noh yea...Silver Medal in the wheat beer category at the US Beer Championships Woot! Woot!",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

With an eye toward preserving and growing one-of-a-kind craft beers and brands, CBA was joined by Kona Brewing Company in 2010.\r\nWhen Kurt & Rob Widmer founded Widmer Brothers Brewing in 1984, they didn\u2019t confine their brewing exploration to strict style guidelines. To this day, Widmer Brothers continues to create handcrafted beers with a unique and unconventional twist on traditional styles that are award winning and please a wide range of craft beer lovers.\r\n\r\nRedhook began in a Seattle transmission shop in 1981, and those colorful roots are reflected in the brand\u2019s personality to this day. As one of the country\u2019s first craft breweries, Redhook continues to offer sessionable craft beers to consumers across the country.\r\n\r\nKona Brewing was founded in 1994 by the father and son team of Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who dreamed of crafting fresh, local island brews with spirit, passion and quality. As the largest craft brewery in Hawaii, Kona personifies the laid-back, passionate lifestyle and environmental respect of the people and culture of Hawaii.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

                    "description": "Uinta Brewing Company embarked upon its mission of brewing world class, full-flavored, craft-brewed beer in the winter of 1993. From a small, renovated mechanic\u2019s garage located in Salt Lake City, Uinta began distributing a tasty variety of beer ranging from 4.0% to over 10% alcohol by volume to local bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Demand escalated, resulting in the installation of a bottling line in 1996. Then, in 2001, having outgrown its original building, Uinta built and relocated to a 26,000-square-foot facility, specifically designed for brewing beer. \r\nUinta Brewing is named after an east-west mountain range located in northeastern Utah. Many of Uinta\u2019s beer names are inspired by Utah\u2019s diverse landscapes or have historical significance. Cutthroat Pale Ale, Uinta\u2019s flagship beer, is named after Utah\u2019s state fish. Subsequent beer names followed suit, such as King's Peak Porter, named after Utah\u2019s highest peak, Golden Spike Hefeweizen, named after the spike used to commemorate the completion of the transcontinental railroad in Utah, and Dubhe, named after the Utah Centennial star.\r\nIn desire of creating a different experience in beer, Uinta launched its Crooked Line in 2010. These beers were dubbed \u201cbig beers\u201d both in taste, alcohol content (ranging from 9 to over 13% alcohol by volume) and size of bottle.  Crooked Line beers are packaged in 750 ml bottles and are cork finished. Knowing that each beer was quite different from the next, it was essential that each brew showcased its individuality outside the bottle as well. Uinta sought the talents of local artists to design the labels, assuring that each style was unique in packaging as well as in style and taste. The launch of the Crooked Line was quickly followed by the grand opening of the Little Big Beer Store\u2014an on-site store selling higher alcohol content beers\u2014refrigerated!\r\nInspired by an upcoming 20th anniversary, Uinta Brewery sought a fresh approach in showcasing its products while maintaining the classic Uinta feel which reflects an appreciation for the outdoors and characteristics of the mountain west.  Uinta Brewing spent most of 2010-2011 going through a massive redesign of its logo, labels, all packaging and its bottle. The process enabled Uinta to clearly organize and define three lines of beers under the Uinta Family:  The Classic Line, Organic Line and Crooked Line. \r\nUinta designed a custom, proprietary 12 ounce bottle as part of the redesign project. Referred to as the \u201ccompass bottle,\u201d the new bottle shape is branded by a 360-degree compass embossed into the bottle\u2019s shoulder.  The upshot?  You\u2019ll never get lost with a Uinta bottle in hand!  Naturally, adopting the custom-shaped bottle gave rise to the need for a substantial investment in new bottling line equipment.\r\nThe redesigned logo embodies the uniqueness of the company\u2019s namesake, the Uinta Mountains.  A compass is integrated into the logo with the needle pointing East-West, referencing the only major range facing East-West in the continental U.S.. The compass also speaks to Uinta\u2019s sense of exploration and direction as Uinta consistently strives to brew the best beer possible. \u201cEarth, Wind and Beer\u201d remains part of the logo referring to Uinta\u2019s long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship. \r\nSince 2001 Uinta Brewing has been 100% wind-powered, becoming the first Utah company to reach this mark. In an effort to continue its commitment to using renewable resources, Uinta Brewing installed solar-electric paneling on the brewery\u2019s roof in 2011.  \r\n Uinta beers have received awards and medals from regional, national, and international competitions, including the North American Beer Awards, World Beer Cup, and Great American Beer Festival. \r\nUinta is committed to brewing world-class beer using the best practices and ingredients.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

While your \"good\" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nHistory - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as \u201cup-tight\u201d without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.\r\nHolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one\u2019s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the \u201cLiquid Confession\u201d. What better way to cleanse one\u2019s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one\u2019s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.\r\nJoin the movement in guilt-free pleasure and refreshment. Have your liquid confession today and enjoy life to its fullest.",

Its effervescent head, delicate tangy taste, and crisp clear finish make it a refreshing, thirst quenching delight. High Rollers Wheat Beer can be enjoyed alone or with a slice of lemon. Excellent as an aperitif or with lighter fare, such as gazpacho, salads, or sushi. Unlike most cloudy wheat beers, this unique brew is sparklingly clear and has been known to win over even the most ardent domestic beer and wine fans. Best when served in a tall pilsner-style glass.\r\n\r\nHigh Rollers Wheat Beer won the Gold Medal at the 2000 Great American Beer Festival, in the American-Style Wheat Ale category, and has several other medals, as well.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our products, High Rollers Wheat Beer is never sterile filtered nor heat pasteurized, and should be stored in refrigeration. However, to fully enjoy its rich and complex flavor, it should be served between 40\u00b0 and 45\u00b0F",

Our brewery is run on 100% wind power!\r\n\r\nChris Asher decided that the Boulder market deserved to have locally brewed organic beers. After nearly a year of planning, research, and hard work building a brewery, Asher Brewing Company opened the doors for business on November 20th, 2009.  \r\n\r\nOn February 25th, 2010 organic certification was issued for all beers at Asher Brewing Company; making it the first all organic brewery in the state of Colorado. Organic ingredients are better for the consumer, better for the environment, and better for the beer.

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

            "description": "Hoegaarden is the authentic Belgian wheat or white beer. It has a unique and extremely complex brewing process whereby the brand is first top fermented and then is refermented within the bottle - ending up in a unique cloudy-white appearance. The brand's unique appearance is mirrored by its one-of-a-kind taste - sweet and sour beer with a little bitterness, slightly spicy, with a strong touch of coriander and a hint of orange, perfect for warm summer days, instead of other refreshing beverages. Refreshing, a little quirky, and decidedly different - naturally.",

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

Started by military veterans Brian Evitts (U.S. Navy), and Mike Ratkowski (U.S. Army). They met as managers of the same company and were drawn together by the same home brewing passion to make excellent beers. Brian has been an avid home brewer for almost 15 years, while Mike has always enjoyed the culture of breweries. They both felt there was a lack of their style of beer--beer focused on the malted barley and not so focused on the hops.\r\n\r\nRailhouse Brewery currently offers seasonal and year-round beers, including the following: Mastiff Oatmeal Stout, KA-BAR Brown Ale, FCA IPA, Vanilla Porter, Barleywine, and Pale Ale. The brewery and pub is located at 105 East South Street, Aberdeen, NC.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

            "description": "Volume # 2 in the 20th Anniversary series for Schlafly Brand Beers is Schlafly Hop Toddy Ale. This beer was brewed by the brewers who started between 1992 and 1997. Using a local farm connection which grows raw unmalted wheat was one of the elements of this beer. It is a slightly stronger wheat beer with an ABV of 7% aged in bourbon barrels. It has a light amber color mainly from the Honey Malt used in the brew, a heaping helping of locally grown wildflower honey as well as color pick up from char in the bourbon barrels. There is a citrus quality to this beer as well from both the use of lemon juice and Citra hops in both the kettle, whirlpool and dry-hopping. The combination of honey, citrus and bourbon flavors is reminiscent of a Hot Toddy and was a theme from which we worked this variation. Quite frankly we don\u2019t know what to expect from such a beer, but look forward to when it is ready. We hope you enjoy this sampling of our personal stamp on the discovery and wonder of the art of exploration in brewing.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

                    "description": "Rogue Ales was founded in 1988 by Jack Joyce, Rob Strasser and Bob Woodell, three corporate types who wanted to go into the food/beverage industry. Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

                    "description": "Jamesport Center is a late Victorian six storefront complex. The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company",

In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

We are one of the smallest breweries in North Carolina and also one of the smallest in the country. We have a 1.5 bbl brewhouse , 1 and 3 bbl fermentation tanks.

We utilize many ingredients from all over the world, selecting only the finest grains, cultured yeast, fresh whole hops, and  our mountain water that is perfect for producing the best beers possible.  Another advantage of being small is that we can produce a wide variety of styles so our selection will always be changing. We will produce beers that fit the season and year round classics. Loe's Brewing takes pride in producing the finest handcrafted beers, and we are sure that once you try our beer you will agree that bigger is not always better , and will notice the difference that craft beer has to offer.

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

You may better remember the building as the former home of the Shanghai Restaurant and bar, where scenes from the movie, Phenomenon were filmed.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance of the Auburn Alehouse combines the charm and character of this historic brick and mortar building with the bold industrial elements of a gleaming 10-barrel microbrewery.\r\n\r\nGuests and friends can enjoy lunch, dinner, and libation while watching the freshly crafted beer they are drinking being produced just a few feet away.\r\n\r\nThere is also an outdoor patio with a great view of the historic Auburn courthouse. There are always at least 6-8 beers on tap and Hard Cider and select \"guest\" craft beers are also available on draught. Interestingly, the Auburn Alehouse is located just 1/10th of a mile from the original Auburn Brewery, which brewed for thirsty Auburnites from 1855 until 1908. You may stop by for the ale, but you\u2019ll find the food is a star attraction as well. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for pub fare or a sit down dinner, there is something for every one at the Alehouse.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.",

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.",

Ninety five percent of all the beer we brew at Altitude is ale, including our award winning 7200\u2019 Stout and Rosebud Strong Ale.\r\n\r\nOur beer is brewed using single step and multi-step infusion mashing, which is patterned off the British brewing tradition.  All of our beer is made from four basic ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and water. Our recipes use American malts, hops from Europe and America, and yeast cultured from the traditional yeast stocks found throughout the world. We do not filter our beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew over 20 styles of beer throughout the year. We offer eight beers on tap year round and we pour up to three specialty beers at any given time.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to try Altitude\u2019s microbrews and we hope you\u2019ll like them as much as we do!",

Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.\r\n\r\nToday, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!",

We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

Excellent with salads and some of our lighter fare. Enjoy!",

Our selection of hand crafted lagers and ales are produced on premises using the finest grains and hops. We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite.

                    "description": "Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

The raspberries provide the lager with a subtle purple coloration and haze, a fruity aroma, and a tartly sweet taste.\r\n\r\nThis beer is best served with salads or light fruit desserts, such as souffl\u00e9s or chiffon cakes. Many people enjoy it with chocolate desserts. Purple Haze pairs well with certain cheeses, such as ripened Brie or any dessert made with Mascarpone. It\u2019s also great paired with entrees prepared with fruit, especially citrus. Consider enjoying Purple Haze alone at the end of your meal as dessert.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

After Homebrewing for several years, we've decided to expand to our new location (2667 Kirkwood Highway - Newark, DE) and install a 1.5 barrel brewery, making us the smallest brewery in the state of Delaware. We brew beers to please all kinds, including an Amber Ale, Rye Stout and an IPA that recently won a ribbon at the Delaware State Fair Battle of the Brews.\r\n\r\nSince we're so small, we'll be sure to experiment with several different styles of beer, so there will always be something new to check out.  Along with the beer, we'll have the same great pizzas we've been serving up for over 33 years. We'll also have soups, salads, pub sandwiches and select entrees. Also be on the lookout for our occasional beer dinners and pizza beer dinners.   We're just as passionate about our food as we are about our beer.",

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

The two dreamed of starting a Brewpub that offered many varieties of house-brewed ales and lagers and hearty made-from-scratch pub fare to accompany the beers. The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

                    "description": "Bar AreaThe Blind Tiger Brewery and Restaurant first opened its doors for business in May 1995, becoming the first microbrewery in the city and the largest brewery in Kansas. The Blind Tiger Brewery was named after the Prohibition-era custom of displaying stuffed tigers to alert patrons to speakeasies or the availability of alcohol. True to our name, we serve handcrafted beers, all of which we brew here locally. The Blind Tiger Brewery is, in itself, a huge establishment, with an incredible multi-level interior. Seating capacity rests at 300 on eight different levels, including an outdoor deck. Our unique lighting, and rich decorated cedar interior creates an ambience for everyone to enjoy. Our own special bar and lounge offers full menu service with seating for 150. You can catch your favorite sporting event on one of 18 televisions or on our HUGE 8' x 10' projection screen TV.  For those who are first time visitors to our brewery, check out the memorabilia that covers the walls \u2013 national and local celebrities and events!",

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.",

Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

Because we believe that craft beer is best enjoyed fresh, Twisted Pine ales can only be found throughout Colorado.

It is our intention to bring to you a select family of individually distinctive ales that we as brewers would enjoy drinking ourselves. That is our final measure. We ignore costs, fads, and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too seriously. After all, we realize brewing a fine beer isn't exactly nuclear physics. It's something far more important. -Twistedpine.com",

Lastly, we added REAL raspberry puree for a fresh fruit flavor and a bit of color. Brewed with Pale and Wheat Malts. Hopped with American hops.",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

The Blind Tiger Brewery was named after the Prohibition-era custom of displaying stuffed tigers to alert patrons to speakeasies or the availability of alcohol. True to our name, we serve handcrafted beers, all of which we brew here locally. The Blind Tiger Brewery is, in itself, a huge establishment, with an incredible multi-level interior. Seating capacity rests at 300 on eight different levels, including an outdoor deck. Our unique lighting, and rich decorated cedar interior creates an ambience for everyone to enjoy. Our own special bar and lounge offers full menu service with seating for 150. You can catch your favorite sporting event on one of 18 televisions or on our HUGE 8' x 10' projection screen TV.  For those who are first time visitors to our brewery, check out the memorabilia that covers the walls \u2013 national and local celebrities and events!",

                    "description": "Good ideas often start over beer. Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.",

Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

The floral and slightly spicy aroma allow for a pint that will satisfy your buds.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.",

Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.

We use only the finest domestic and imported barley and hops to brew beers of tradition and beers of distinction. The brew house we call home is a 15 barrel Pub Brewing System located on the upper level of the impressive brewery interior. In the past year, we have doubled our production to exceed 1000 barrels (2000 Kegs) per year and have begun distributing to other bars and restaurants throughout Kansas.",

Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

            "description": "Meaning \"rye bread\" in Danish, we took our inspiration for this beer from the Danes' staple dark, whole-grain rye bread. Brewed with three types of rye malt, this robust brown ale showcases the earthy, spicy character of the grain, complemented by bready, nutty barley malts and a hint of roast. Loosely based on the Scandinavian Christmas beer or \"Julebryg\" tradition, this beer is perfect for the colder weather of winter, although it will be available year-round (because who doesn't love a dark beer now and again, regardless of weather?) And don\u2019t worry about the name, we can\u2019t pronounce it either! But we do have a video of us and a lot of others trying our best at it. http://www.vimeo.com/7504797.",

My great friend, and then neighbor, Randy and I decided it was time to start brewing beer since we could not longer get our then favorite brew in the stores. Our first beer was aptly named \"Girly Beer\" and was light and refreshing.\r\n\r\nFrom there the brews continued until we were out of storage space. Our paths separated, but we each continued brewing. My brother Mike, soon took to brewing also and has been an avid brewer for many years now.\r\n\r\nBackground experience comes from homebrewing, being head brewer at Hal and Mal's in Jackson, MS, and head brewer at Riverhorse, in Lambertville, NJ.",

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!",

At 6.5% ABV with around 20% rye addition, this beer brings the perfect balance of rye on the nose, a touch of Northwest hops, and a clean, dry finish. When asked what to call the beer, Brewer Cole proudly stated, \"What do you mean? Call it what it is - rye on the pallet.\" We took the meaning a couple ways.",

Looking around at what other breweries in the SE were doing, Spike and John felt they could make a contribution. Realizing that anyone could make just another pale ale, brown ale or stout, Spike and John set their sights on crafting beers unlike any that were currently available in the SE.\r\n\r\nTerrapin introduced its first beer, the Rye Pale Ale in April of 2002. Six months later while only available on draft in Athens, Terrapin\u2019s sole offering won the American Pale Ale Gold Medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival.

Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

You know the triangle packaged ones that have mystery meat in them? Don't lie, you've had one. Today it is home to JailHouse Brewing Company and we are brewing hand-crafted beer not punching out license plates.",

Owner/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.",

For the first summer the Event Center kept the main floor as a stage and dance floor. For the first summer we offered four beers:  Estes Park Porter, Estes Park Renegade, Longs Peak Raspberry Wheat and Estes Park Pale Ale.  In the fall of 1994, Gordon Knight decided to sell his half of the business. When Gordon left, Eric Bratrud took over as the head Brewer. The Brewery also expanded to a 14 BBL Brewhouse and moved out onto the main floor where is now located. In 1995 we started packaging our beers in 12 oz bottles, which expanded our market. By this time we had added a number of beers including Trail Ridge Red, Estes Park Gold, Stinger Wild Honey Wheat and Samson Stout. 1995 was also the first year of the Best of the West Brewfest held in the Brewery parking lot. Since '95 we've continued to evolve both in our restaurant and with our brewing operations. In 2003 Tyler Lemirande and Eric Bratrud took over as owners.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

It is fermented with a traditional top-fermenting \"ale\" yeast, yielding a clean, balanced flavor that highlights the refreshingly light flavor of malted wheat. The head is unusually abundant due to the natural protein deposits of wheat, with a thick consistency similar to meringue.\r\n\r\nFirst brewed in the summer of 1984, Anchor Summer \u00ae Beer is the first American wheat beer in modern times.

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Caf\u00e9 had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub\u2019s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing\u2019s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf\u00e9 in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to \u201cimplied ingredients\u201d that weren\u2019t actually present in the beers.",

It's had its history as the jail, fire station, courthouse, mason lodge, and last but not least a sandwich shop that made those little sandwiches you can buy in gas stations. You know the triangle packaged ones that have mystery meat in them? Don't lie, you've had one. Today it is home to JailHouse Brewing Company and we are brewing hand-crafted beer not punching out license plates.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The flavors coalesce into a complex but easy-drinking beer that pairs great with salads, vinaigrettes, sushi, Mexican and Thai dishes, mild fish such as sole or halibut, and goat\u2019s milk or young, soft-ripened cheeses.",

Six months later while only available on draft in Athens, Terrapin\u2019s sole offering won the American Pale Ale Gold Medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Wormtown Punk Punk Press was gobbled up by the musicians and music fans of Worcester who craved news and information about the exciting sounds emanating from the local airwaves and rock clubs. Wormtown Punk Punk Press featured groups from Worcester like the Blue Moon Band and Crazy Jack, and from Boston like Willie Alexander, DMZ and The Real Kids. The 'zine hit a nerve in the city and those who were entranced with punk picked up on the name Wormtown and adopted it quickly to represent themselves and their emerging culture. Within a year an album showcasing the city's best punk bands entitled Wormtown '78 was produced, effectively branding the local music scene, and the city of Worcester, forever.\r\n\r\n?Not everyone identifies with Wormtown. Not everyone is involved with the underground music scene in the city, not everyone is a fan of punk. But the name has stuck and has been adopted by countless Worcester citizens because it symbolizes and embraces the free spirited do-it-yourself ethic that is simply Worcester. Over the years it has meant many things to many people and sometimes frowned upon as derogatory by some, when actually it helped change the culture of the city in a way where anyone could strike out on their own and create music, art or a collective of liked minded individuals. Wormtown Brewery has that same spirit - they are creating something unique to add to the mix in our city. Will it change Worcester the way music did back in the late '70s? Who knows. But one thing is for sure, there is nothing that goes better with good music than good beer.",

                    "description": "In the spring of 2010, Larry and Peter Geaghan began exploring the idea of expanding operations at Geaghan's Pub to include a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Maine.  Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness.

At the tender age of 13 both knew what they wanted to do for a living... make and drink good beer.  Just kidding!!\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words \"Town Hall\" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.  Please come and taste our award winning beer and fantastic food.  Food and beverages are served in our bar, dining room and lounge.  Outdoor seating is available on our spacious patio from April 1 (weather permitting) until the snow flies in winter.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Ninety five percent of all the beer we brew at Altitude is ale, including our award winning 7200\u2019 Stout and Rosebud Strong Ale.\r\n\r\nOur beer is brewed using single step and multi-step infusion mashing, which is patterned off the British brewing tradition.  All of our beer is made from four basic ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and water. Our recipes use American malts, hops from Europe and America, and yeast cultured from the traditional yeast stocks found throughout the world. We do not filter our beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew over 20 styles of beer throughout the year. We offer eight beers on tap year round and we pour up to three specialty beers at any given time.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to try Altitude\u2019s microbrews and we hope you\u2019ll like them as much as we do!",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

Our publicly-held brewery employs over 150 people who are as passionate about quality craft beer as Kurt & Rob themselves.\r\n\r\nWe opened the brewery in 1984, and built a new 40-barrel brewing system in our current Russell Street location in 1990. We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Visually the beer is somewhat hazy \u2013 this is the hefe,  taste-wise it is light yet malty \u2013 this is the weizen. This mouth-watering brew is often served with a slice of lemon for a zesty summer cooler.

After years of brewing and competing with each other for kudos in their local community, Mike Price and Jon Northup decided to join forces and produce the best beer that we\u2014using our combined brewing experience\u2014could produce.\r\n\r\nSaint Boniface is the name of the patron saint of brewers, the saint also associated with converting Germany to Christianity. St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer \u201cpagans\u201d worshiping the false gods of the big beer industry and see that it is time to take a Boniface-like swing at converting some of those people to a better way of life, one full of rich, tasty, more satisfying brews.",

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.

Our selection of hand crafted lagers and ales are produced on premises using the finest grains and hops. We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite.

We are a family company born of a deep passion for beer and a great reverence for brewing history, tradition and culture. Our motto is Celebrating Beer. This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.). Baird Beer also is sold through a steadily expanding family of outside pubs, restaurants and liquor stores in Japan as well as being exported to select international markets. Consumer purchases of Baird Beer direct from the brewery are possible through our online estore (delivery only within Japan).",

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

The Tax and Trade Bureau (formerly ATF) rejected our original label approval application, claiming that use of the word wine in a beer name would confuse and mislead consumers and retailers. We didn't agree (barleywine, anyone?) and appealed their rejection. Ours is the first, but definitely not the last, wheat wine application the federal government has seen, so they had to create new guidelines regarding the use of this name. We did prevail, at last, and the issue has been put to rest, and although there are several outstanding examples of this style offered at brewpubs, we are pleased to say that Smuttynose Wheat Wine Ale was the first commercially bottled Wheat Wine on the market.\r\n\r\nGOLD MEDAL WINNER - 2005 Great American Beer Festival.\r\nGOLD MEDAL WINNER - 2010 Mondial de la Biere, Strasbourg, France",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window.

            "description": "Jasper Akerboom and Peter Lee are both scientists at Howard Hughes' Janelia Farm, located in Ashburn. Taking a scientific approach towards brewing (Jasper has a PhD in microbiology and food technology, Peter has worked in large-scale process and discovery chemistry in industry), they wanted to focus on beers brewed with locally isolated yeasts. Jasper isolated several interesting strains and brewed small-scale test batches. After meeting Lost Rhino brewmaster Favio Garcia, they knew they shared the same passion for locally crafted beer using local ingredients, including local yeast. The idea for a summer beer using local yeast was born. They teamed up and designed a hoppy wheat beer for summer: Wild Farmwell Wheat. Farmwell is the old name for Ashburn where we isolated the strain.",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

We offer an excellent casual, yet professional, dining experience for our guests, never pretentious, emphasizing \"fun & friendly... brewpub style\" menu selections and service. We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC\u2019s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that\u2019s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.  \r\n\r\nPBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014\u2026.thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we\u2019ll just keep on keepin\u2019 on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.\r\n\r\nYOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn\u2019t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we\u2019re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes. Prescott is an amazing community...let\u2019s keep it that way! THANKS A BUNCH!\r\n\r\nJohn and Roxane Nielsen",

There were years of home brew competitions, brew science classes, and extended beer runs thinly disguised as vacations. \r\nThe brewery went through an expansion starting in late 2008 and became operational in mid 2009. Four double sized fermentors were installed in an old garage behind the current brewery. A cold box was erected adjacent to the garage and a bottling machine with a nice labeler are housed there too.

It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.",

Inspired by Winterthur\u2019s rolling fields, we named our wheat beer after this nearby American country estate. In addition to its architectural beauty, Winterthur also features the art of such noted local artists as George \u201cFrolic\u201d Weymouth, whose painting \u201cWheat\u201d is on our label.",

Wormtown Punk Punk Press was gobbled up by the musicians and music fans of Worcester who craved news and information about the exciting sounds emanating from the local airwaves and rock clubs. Wormtown Punk Punk Press featured groups from Worcester like the Blue Moon Band and Crazy Jack, and from Boston like Willie Alexander, DMZ and The Real Kids. The 'zine hit a nerve in the city and those who were entranced with punk picked up on the name Wormtown and adopted it quickly to represent themselves and their emerging culture. Within a year an album showcasing the city's best punk bands entitled Wormtown '78 was produced, effectively branding the local music scene, and the city of Worcester, forever.\r\n\r\n?Not everyone identifies with Wormtown. Not everyone is involved with the underground music scene in the city, not everyone is a fan of punk. But the name has stuck and has been adopted by countless Worcester citizens because it symbolizes and embraces the free spirited do-it-yourself ethic that is simply Worcester. Over the years it has meant many things to many people and sometimes frowned upon as derogatory by some, when actually it helped change the culture of the city in a way where anyone could strike out on their own and create music, art or a collective of liked minded individuals. Wormtown Brewery has that same spirit - they are creating something unique to add to the mix in our city. Will it change Worcester the way music did back in the late '70s? Who knows. But one thing is for sure, there is nothing that goes better with good music than good beer.",

We enjoy the history of beer, its humble, but amazing beginnings, the way it brings people together, and it\u2019s unbelievable versatility. We truly believe you should follow your passion and enjoy life. How better to do that than open Thirsty Planet Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nOur purpose then morphs into doing the right thing. For us, this includes being environmentally conscious. We have laced filters in our drains for run-off water, so we can use that water to irrigate our lawns and plants. We also plan to purchase solar panels for our brewery. We recycle, and you will quickly learn that after visiting our beautiful tasting room. Check out our bar, you will see what we mean.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of doing the right thing is through charitable donations. We have been truly blessed in life and want to give to those who are in need of a blessing. A portion of our Yellow Armadillo Wheat sales will go to a local cancer research/support foundation, and a portion of our Thirsty Goat Amber sales will go to help purchase farm animals (maybe goats?) for needy people in third world countries. So, not only can we feel good for helping people, you can feel good every time you purchase Thirsty Planet beer. It\u2019s a win-win situation!!!",

Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Our role as an integral member of the artisan approach is something we take seriously, yet engage lightheartedly.\r\n\r\nWe believe the art of craft lives in fostering rich experiences for our customers, through creating authentic beer, spirits and food while providing great service. Recognized for our creativity and artistry, our mission to improve the lives of craft consumers everywhere is seen in our diverse, balanced collection of beer and spirits.\r\n\r\nNew Holland brews and distills at two locations in Holland, Michigan: our production facility on the north side and our Pub & Restaurant in downtown Holland. The restaurant welcomes guests seven days a week and production tours are on Saturday afternoons. We welcome visitors and locals alike, and appreciate the opportunity to share our artisan approach through warm hospitality and enriching education.\r\n\r\nWith just under 150 employees, New Holland Brewing Co. sells its beer and spirits across a growing regional landscape, while anchored in the upper Midwest. In 2012, our production facility underwent substantial development including the tripling of our brewing capacity through outdoor fermentation, the addition of a centrifuge and the expansion of our Dragon\u2019s Milk cellar. In 2013, the company is expanding its distilling capabilities, renovating the downtown Holland Pub & Restaurant and focusing on the integration of Michigan agriculture; hops, wheat and barley, into several new and existing brands.",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!",

                "description": "This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It can be brewed with 30 to 75 percent wheat malt, and hop rates may be low to medium. Hop characters may be light to moderate in bitterness, flavor and aroma. Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",
