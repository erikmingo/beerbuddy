Thus, our beer is brewed and bottled with our own hands on Madison\u2019s East Side. In fact, ALE ASYLUM operates the only bottling facility in Madison.\r\n\r\nALE ASYLUM is unfiltered and all natural. We use no additives, preservatives, fruit, horse hooves, fish guts, or extracts. Our ingredient list: water, malt, hops, and yeast. This is what we mean when we say our beer is FERMENTED IN SANITY. You know who makes it, you know what it\u2019s made with. You know after having one you\u2019ll want another.\r\n\r\nWe brew traditional, bold beers for those who demand quality and consistency. To those people we say: raise a pint, because you believe how we believe.",

The microbrewery is located in a 7,000-square-foot (650 m2) factory in in Red Hook, Brooklyn that formerly manufactured filing cabinets. Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.  Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.",

                "description": "The German word Bernsteinfarben means amber colored, and as such, a Bernsteinfarbenes Weizen is dark yellow to amber in color. This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and caramel or bready character from the use of medium colored malts. Estery and phenolic elements of this Weissbier should be evident but subdued. Bernsteinfarbenes Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, and hop bitterness is low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. The percentage of wheat malt is at least 50 percent. If this is served with yeast, the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.",
