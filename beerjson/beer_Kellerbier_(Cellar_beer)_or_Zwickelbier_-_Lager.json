                    "description": "The Evans family was in the commercial brewing business for three generations. The original brewery was built in Hudson, NY in 1786. It continued production until prohibition in 1920. Its award winning ales were well known in the Northeast and were even exported to England and France. Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.\r\n\r\nThe brewery bottled its own beer in Hudson at one of the country\u2019s earliest bottling facilities (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H. Evans Brewing Company memorabilia is displayed in the new facility, as well as pictures of the pump station as it appeared at the turn of the century.",

In accordance with the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law of 1516), bock beers must have a pre-fermentation malt sugar concentration of 16%, which converts over to at least 7% alcohol after fermentation. These strong beers were made popular in the early 1600s by monks in order to minimize their hunger during fasting periods. While most bocks are dark, Blonde Bock is golden-colored and malty with a rich, creamy head. The rich flavor is counterbalanced with just the right level of bitterness from the Hallertau aroma hops and create a very smooth profile.",

It is unfiltered, relatively low in alcohol, and served very soon after fermentation is complete. For this reason, Zwickelbiers usually don\u2019t make it very far from the brewery where they are produced. Our version is brewed with 100% German Pils and Vienna malts and Czech Saaz hops. A cold fermentation with a classic Bavarian lager yeast lets the pure flavors of the malt and hops shine through. Get out your biggest beer stein for this one!",
