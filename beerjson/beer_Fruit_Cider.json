The cider is traditionally fined to give it brightness in both appearance and flavour. Balmain Cider is a medium dry cider with great sharpness and a refreshing aromatic apple aroma.",

Utilizing his insider's view of the cider industry, he took more than two years to develop the Ace Cider. House, owner of the second largest specialty beer and cider marketing company in the US, began importing ciders into the US in 1986. Since then he has seen explosive sales growth, as hard cider has moved beyond specialty beer and liquor stores and established itself on the supermarket shelves as a new drink category.\r\n\r\nWith Sonoma's superior apple juice giving Ace Ciders their great fresh taste and House's expertise and in-depth knowledge of the hard cider business providing a marketing edge, CCC is beginning to take a dominant position in this increasingly significant new beverage market.\r\n\r\nAs with all alcoholic beverages, we urge you to please drink responsibly.",

Since then he has seen explosive sales growth, as hard cider has moved beyond specialty beer and liquor stores and established itself on the supermarket shelves as a new drink category.\r\n\r\nWith Sonoma's superior apple juice giving Ace Ciders their great fresh taste and House's expertise and in-depth knowledge of the hard cider business providing a marketing edge, CCC is beginning to take a dominant position in this increasingly significant new beverage market.\r\n\r\nAs with all alcoholic beverages, we urge you to please drink responsibly.",

Not much as changed in the process since then. We use the same apples from the same orchards as my great-great grandfather did before the time of the Civil War. We are proud of that. It gives us a sense of history.\r\n\r\nThe cider has played an important role in the ongoing history of our farm. The sale of cider actually saved our farm during the Great Depression. And, during the Prohibition people came from far and wide for our \"Special Farm Cider.\"",

Supported by a local wine expert, he began mixing and testing in a small upstate New York winery, and brought his samples to NYC bars each week for feedback from owners, managers, and patrons. After six months, the first batch of O.S. was released to establishments in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Soon after, the product received critical acclaim from sources as diverse as The New York Times, New York Post, Paper Magazine, and Market Watch.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",
