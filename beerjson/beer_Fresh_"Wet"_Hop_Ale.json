Though significantly more assertive, Boulevard 21st Anniversary Fresh Hop Pale Ale is brewed in loving tribute to that original Pale Ale. English pale malt gives the brew a rich, nutty malt flavor. Munich and Caramel malts add color and body, while a blend of Cascade, Hallertau, Magnum, Styrian Golding, and Centennial hops contribute scintillating citrus aromas and complex, peppery notes.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: This is a beer that is best enjoyed fresh. It will not be enhanced by cellaring for weeks or months, so there\u2019s no reason to wait. It\u2019s time to celebrate, and\u2014now that we\u2019re old enough to order a beer for ourselves\u2014we plan to raise a glass or two in November to mark the occasion. Please join us! Cheers!",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",

We then packed it with Freshly harvested Centennial Hops from the Pacific Northwest. These hops were picked, flown overnight to California and put into this special brew all within a 24 hour window. Because these hops are completely unprocessed and so fresh, they possess flavor and aroma qualities completely unique to traditionally dried hops.

We currently offer two delicious styles of beer on draft in select Atlanta establishments.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the idea for Monday Night Brewing grew out of a small Atlanta Bible study. We started brewing beer together on Monday nights as a way to get to know each other better. As we got more engrained in the industry and more people started showing up to brew with us, beer quickly became more than just a weeknight hobby.\r\n\r\nWe spent almost 5 years perfecting our Eye Patch Ale and Drafty Kilt Scotch Ale before bringing them to market. Years of minor tweaks, arguments over hop profiles, and experiments with different brands of base malts are poured into every glass that we brew.",

Amid the clank of modern machinery, a group of workers busy themselves with one of the world's oldest crafts: brewing. At Gizmo Brew Works, this meeting of contemporary technology and ancient know-how produces a tempting slate of small-batch beers. Inside tanks that hold the equivalent of 1,000 pints each, brewers prep favorites including the smooth and sweet Black Stiletto Stout and the complex Palisade Wasp India Pale Ale with the same care that has earned many of their past beers medals at the Carolina Championship of Beer. They also save room for seasonals, carefully adding a sweet caramel flavor and spicy Noble hops to their altbier. These beers and more make frequent appearances in the brewery's taproom, gracing pint glasses for impromptu toasts or filling up growlers for at-home sips. Never ones to shy away from curious guests, brewers also open up their facility for Saturday tours, walking groups through the beer-making process during 30-minute explorations.",

In 2012, our production facility underwent substantial development including the tripling of our brewing capacity through outdoor fermentation, the addition of a centrifuge and the expansion of our Dragon\u2019s Milk cellar. In 2013, the company is expanding its distilling capabilities, renovating the downtown Holland Pub & Restaurant and focusing on the integration of Michigan agriculture; hops, wheat and barley, into several new and existing brands.",

Hopivore presents a round, deep hop character, balanced by modestly sweet maltiness. Expect a more herbaceous hoppiness than other hop-forward beers.",

With a combined passion for craft beer, Kevin and Marisa set out to start the Vail Valley\u2019s first production brewery. Kevin and Marisa built their brewery from the ground up in a gutted warehouse, shipping in tanks and equipment from around the globe. Their first beer was poured at a beer festival in Vail in January 2010 and they started distributing their beer to local bars and restaurants in March 2010. After an initial expansion, they opened a tasting room to the public in October 2010.",

In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!\r\n\r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly.\r\n\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

To celebrate the hop harvest in the Pacific Northwest, McMenamins brewers have created a seasonal utilizing fresh, undried hops straight from the fields.  Throwing caution to the wind, 30 pounds of fresh Cascade hops are frantically delivered to over 22 McMenamins Breweries all over Washington and Oregon.  Each and every batch of  Thundercone is brewed within hours of the hops being picked off of the vine.  This is a daunting task but one that our brewers feel is well worth the monumental coordination involved.  The resulting beer is a feast for the senses, and an absolute fresh hop showcase.\r\n\r\nPilsner Malt is used as the base malt for this beer to impart a smooth foundation and Belgian Caramel Malt is thrown in for a little color and a slight maltiness.  Dried Centennial hops are used for bittering and some flavoring purposes.  But the real stars of the show are the fresh Cascade hop cones used for both flavoring and aroma.  30 total pounds of fresh Cascades are added in three different additions in every batch.  These fresh Cascades overwhelm Thundercone with an earthy, raw, hop-decadence that can only come from fresh hops.  It is a greener and more unadulterated flavor and aroma than comes from dried hops.  The citrusy, flowery and grapefruit notes usually associated with Cascade hops are still present but with an amazing fresh hop funkiness added into the mix.  This beer is so refreshing and hop-filled that you may think you are dreaming but, like Shakespeare\u2019s play, Thundercone Fresh Hop Ale is in reality a short lived dream come true",

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

There were years of home brew competitions, brew science classes, and extended beer runs thinly disguised as vacations. \r\nThe brewery went through an expansion starting in late 2008 and became operational in mid 2009. Four double sized fermentors were installed in an old garage behind the current brewery. A cold box was erected adjacent to the garage and a bottling machine with a nice labeler are housed there too. There is a small barrel shed on the shady, north side of the garage.",
