In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company",

            "description": "Anchor Steam\u00ae Beer owes its deep amber color, thick, creamy head, and rich, distinctive flavor to a brewing process like none other.\r\n\r\nIt is a process that combines deep respect for brewing tradition with many decades of evolution to arrive at a unique approach: a blend of pale and caramel malts, fermentation with lager yeast at warmer ale temperatures in shallow open-air fermenters, and gentle carbonation in our cellars through an all-natural process called kr\u00e4usening.\r\n\r\nAnchor Steam\u00ae Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when \u201csteam\u201d was a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. While the origin of the name remains shrouded in mystery, it likely relates to the original practice of fermenting the beer on San Francisco\u2019s rooftops in a cool climate. In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name \u201csteam\u201d is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Francisco\u2019s original Anchor Steam\u00ae Beer. The classic of American brewing tradition since 1896.",

Often in the micro brewing industry, quality is compromised for quantity. We brew handcrafted, small batch beers to ensure freshness is as crisp as it is clean. We use only the finest domestic and imported barley and hops to brew beers of tradition and beers of distinction. The brew house we call home is a 15 barrel Pub Brewing System located on the upper level of the impressive brewery interior. In the past year, we have doubled our production to exceed 1000 barrels (2000 Kegs) per year and have begun distributing to other bars and restaurants throughout Kansas.",

We are excited to finally bring our love of beer and commitment to quality to Livermore, the Tri-Valley, and beyond.\r\n\r\nOur story is one of two independent breweries, Mt. Diablo Brewing and Working Man Brewing Company, coming together to work on one common goal.  Both companies were founded by award-winning home brewers who have a passion to bring high quality, well crafted beer that is fresh and local.  A chance meeting brought these working men together; a shared vision now combines forces under one name, Working Man Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nThe company\u2019s brewers have each have spent years working to perfect great beer recipes.  Beer geeks at heart, both will tinker and tweak the ingredients until the product is just right.  The main goal always being to make a beer they could be proud to share and proud to drink. We never let a beer go out the door that we don\u2019t believe in.",

Renew your taste buds with our \u201cCalifornia style\u201d Spring Beer, a unique fusion of a hoppy wheat beer brewed with a blended fermentation of Belgian and American yeast. Pours a hazy gold with a thick, white head. Floral hop aromas abound, complemented by the taste of tangy wheat and spicy Belgian yeast notes with a bitter, slightly sweet, bready finish.\r\n\r\nFor our first Seasonal 4-pack, we decided to create something one of a kind. This beer was fermented in two separate batches, one using a traditional American Ale yeast and the other using a Belgian Wit yeast. The two finished beers were then blended to create an extra layer of complexity and flavor. We also used two new hop varieties: Zythos & Calypso. These hops add a wonderful tropical fruit and pear character to our CSB.",

They chose the name Cismontane because the geographical area it represents, coastal Southern California from Santa Barbara to San Diego. As a brewery we are dedicated to creating the finest beers to represent the unique culture and diverse natural aspects of this region. Each beer is named after a local feature that is unique to the area.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery is located on the side of the largest mountain in Orange County in the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. The great views from Santiago peak and the trails through the canyons provide some of the natural inspiration for the beers and the company.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small and accessible to all with a warm and comfortable tasting area. So don\u2019t hesitate to come by when in the area.\r\n\r\n(cis-mon-tane)\r\n\r\n\u201cThis side of the mountains\u201d, in reference to coastal Southern California.

As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.",

Like what, you wonder? We're making beer with sweet potatoes, corn grits, summer basil, and malted barley house-smoked over hickory. Other successful \"plow to pint\" experiments to-date include beer brewed with scuppernong grapes, persimmon, paw paw, rhubarb and more. \r\n\r\nUltimately, our vision is to craft a year-round, sustainable, scalable, and distinctly Southern beer brewed 100% with local ingredients. That's the quest. We're a long ways from realizing this vision, but we hope you enjoy the adventure as much as we expect to. Interested? Read more about Southern-style beer.",

Knocking over trees and powerlines, this derecho (day-RAY-cho), as the storm is called, left a million without power during a record-breaking heatwave. While the brewery was not damaged, we were left without power and searching for a way to SAVE THE BEER.\r\n\r\nProcuring a generator, we were able to keep the brewery online and the beer saved. One batch of lager fermented at higher temperatures, producing what is called a California Common beer, or steam beer.\r\n\r\nThe storm left us a gift: our lager had changed into a golden opportunity, DERECHO COMMON.\r\n\r\nDERECHO COMMON is deep golden in color, and has toasty, biscuity malt flavors. It is medium bodied with an assertive hop profile. It is dry hopped with Amarillo hops, which give it a spicy, citrusy hop kick on the finish.",

This has been true since the day we quietly opened our first \u00bd barrel brewery and tap room on the west side of Decorah, IA in 2009. The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nToday, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards. We are forward thinkers and cunning crafters, quietly building our revolution. \u201cBig Beers Brewed in Small Batches.\u201d",

Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia. Thanks for your support!",

We purchase our grain by the truckload and the bulk grain is blown into the silo from the grain truck. We use 75-80% of this grain in all of our beers. Then we measure our specialty malts into the mill. At this point we crush the malt so that the husk's are cracked open and the \"meat\" of the grain is exposed.",

The brewers back then had to improvise to cool the beer down, so shallow open fermenters were used to cool the beer creating an abundance of steam as the wort cooled. California common beers are fermented with a lager yeast at ale temperatures, which results in a very distinctive flavor profile that includes both ale and lager characteristics. It is a medium bodied, lightly fruity and effervescent beer made with Northern Brewer and Cascade hops. It is deep gold in color with a nice malty backbone which gives way to a clean hop finish. It pairs well with grilled fish or chicken, light seafood fare, salads and pizza.",

                    "description": "Uinta Brewing Company embarked upon its mission of brewing world class, full-flavored, craft-brewed beer in the winter of 1993. From a small, renovated mechanic\u2019s garage located in Salt Lake City, Uinta began distributing a tasty variety of beer ranging from 4.0% to over 10% alcohol by volume to local bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Demand escalated, resulting in the installation of a bottling line in 1996. Then, in 2001, having outgrown its original building, Uinta built and relocated to a 26,000-square-foot facility, specifically designed for brewing beer. \r\nUinta Brewing is named after an east-west mountain range located in northeastern Utah. Many of Uinta\u2019s beer names are inspired by Utah\u2019s diverse landscapes or have historical significance. Cutthroat Pale Ale, Uinta\u2019s flagship beer, is named after Utah\u2019s state fish. Subsequent beer names followed suit, such as King's Peak Porter, named after Utah\u2019s highest peak, Golden Spike Hefeweizen, named after the spike used to commemorate the completion of the transcontinental railroad in Utah, and Dubhe, named after the Utah Centennial star.\r\nIn desire of creating a different experience in beer, Uinta launched its Crooked Line in 2010. These beers were dubbed \u201cbig beers\u201d both in taste, alcohol content (ranging from 9 to over 13% alcohol by volume) and size of bottle.  Crooked Line beers are packaged in 750 ml bottles and are cork finished. Knowing that each beer was quite different from the next, it was essential that each brew showcased its individuality outside the bottle as well. Uinta sought the talents of local artists to design the labels, assuring that each style was unique in packaging as well as in style and taste. The launch of the Crooked Line was quickly followed by the grand opening of the Little Big Beer Store\u2014an on-site store selling higher alcohol content beers\u2014refrigerated!\r\nInspired by an upcoming 20th anniversary, Uinta Brewery sought a fresh approach in showcasing its products while maintaining the classic Uinta feel which reflects an appreciation for the outdoors and characteristics of the mountain west.  Uinta Brewing spent most of 2010-2011 going through a massive redesign of its logo, labels, all packaging and its bottle. The process enabled Uinta to clearly organize and define three lines of beers under the Uinta Family:  The Classic Line, Organic Line and Crooked Line. \r\nUinta designed a custom, proprietary 12 ounce bottle as part of the redesign project. Referred to as the \u201ccompass bottle,\u201d the new bottle shape is branded by a 360-degree compass embossed into the bottle\u2019s shoulder.  The upshot?  You\u2019ll never get lost with a Uinta bottle in hand!  Naturally, adopting the custom-shaped bottle gave rise to the need for a substantial investment in new bottling line equipment.\r\nThe redesigned logo embodies the uniqueness of the company\u2019s namesake, the Uinta Mountains.  A compass is integrated into the logo with the needle pointing East-West, referencing the only major range facing East-West in the continental U.S.. The compass also speaks to Uinta\u2019s sense of exploration and direction as Uinta consistently strives to brew the best beer possible. \u201cEarth, Wind and Beer\u201d remains part of the logo referring to Uinta\u2019s long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship. \r\nSince 2001 Uinta Brewing has been 100% wind-powered, becoming the first Utah company to reach this mark. In an effort to continue its commitment to using renewable resources, Uinta Brewing installed solar-electric paneling on the brewery\u2019s roof in 2011.  \r\n Uinta beers have received awards and medals from regional, national, and international competitions, including the North American Beer Awards, World Beer Cup, and Great American Beer Festival. \r\nUinta is committed to brewing world-class beer using the best practices and ingredients.",

We are a small brewery, and are truly \u201chands on\u201d every step of the brewing process.  Our goal is to produce the best, most flavorful, most memorable local beers possible.  We think we\u2019ve met that goal, & hope you\u2019ll agree.\r\n\r\nAt Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing.  The most common approach used by the major breweries is a \u2018scientific one\u2019.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get \u2018scientific\u2019 beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That\u2019s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.  Don\u2019t take our word for it; check us out.",

In its original form it is an Amber Ale beer in style, somewhat similar to an Extra Special Bitter (ESB), but is brewed using a special Lager yeast at the high ferment temperatures normally used for Ale\u2019s.\r\n\r\nOur version sees the same technique used, but a lighter grain bill and a heavier late hop regime to add more punchy, summery citrus notes.\r\n\r\nModerate bitterness is balanced by attractive lemon, lime and grapefruit flavours which linger in a refreshing fashion, making this a particularly sessionable drop.",

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.",

Every beer is hand-crafted in small batches using traditional brewing methods. We package our beer in self-pressurizing mini-kegs that hold the equivalent of a case of beer, half\u2013gallon refillable growler bottles and 1/6 barrel (5 gallon) kegs that can be used in commercial and home draft systems. Some of our specialty beers, like our Cherry Ale, will only be available in limited quantities.\r\nWe are a production brewery that sells beer right from the premises. Although we don\u2019t currently have a tasting room where we can sell beer by the glass \u2013 we will be offering samples to help you decide which beer to purchase.\r\n\r\nWe are open to the public Wednesday-Friday 2pm to 7pm, Saturday 12 (noon) to 7pm and Sunday 12 (noon) to 4pm. You can purchase our beers outside of the brewery at The Pour House in Aurora, Indiana, Bakers Discount Liquors in Rising Sun, Indiana and Whitey\u2019s in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. We are also available on draft at Bourbons Bar & Grill in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.",

American crystal malts provide light toast and caramel notes along with the beer\u2019s rich amber hue, while Munich malt supplies Tarnation\u2019s malty body. The complex malt notes balance the ample bitterness of American Northern Brewer hops (the signature hop for this style) giving the beer great balance. An authentic San Francisco lager yeast ferments the brew, yielding a clean, crisp and satisfying beer. This lager requires several weeks of cold conditioning (\u201clagering\u201d), but we think it\u2019s worth the wait.",

The Louisville area has had a number of quality brewpubs for some time now, but still there was simply not enough beer! Against the Grain is an effort to help solve this problem. We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window. We aren't just another brewpub. We are Against the Grain!",

However, the American-grown versions are often considered inferior to the German for use as an aroma hop.",

The idea for Black Acre initially was conceived in 2010 due to our love of brewing, great beer, and the beer community at large. We created Black Acre with the goal of contributing delicious and unique beers to the community in which we live.\r\n\r\nBlack Acre hand crafts its ales using a custom fabricated 3 barrel electric brewing system. The brewery will produce four house beers along with an ever rotating selection of seasonal and specialty beers. Distribution will be primarily though in house tap room sales although there will be limited outside distribution. Our beers are not ready quite yet, but stop by for a glass of one of our delicious guest taps and meet the staff.",
