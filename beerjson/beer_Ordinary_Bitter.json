In short, to make outstanding beer.\r\n\r\nHow do we plan to do it? It involves using fresh, high-quality ingredients and a steady hand at the kettle. But that\u2019s just half of it. The other half of it is right here. The power of the internet, social media, and networking is here to see. Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.",

Despite the restrictions placed upon Shaun in terms of both time and space, you can see from the photographs just how much can be achieved in a small, basic garage.

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",

Bitters are low alcohol (3 to 4.5% abv) pale ales that are often dry hopped and served on cask. Our take on the style is suitably sessionable at a modest 4% abv, but we wanted to turn it up a notch in the hop department \u2013 so instead of using the mellower English hop varieties we blasted it with a blend of Centennial and Chinook in the kettle, followed by a hefty dry hop with more Centennial. The result? A great beer to get your hop fix with and still be able to drive home!",

We sprinkle warm water over the Old Foghorn mash after the first \u201cwort\u201d has run off, creating a second, lighter brew. Technically, both beers are \"ales\" because they are made with top-fermenting yeast. Like its forebears, the result is an easy-drinking \u201csession\u201d beer.\r\n\r\nFor hundreds of years, the term \"small beer\" was used in English to describe the lighter, less expensive counterpart to barleywine. In our revival of this ancient tradition, Anchor Small\u00ae Beer is resourcefulness at its best \u2013 beer begets beer.",

                    "description": "Andy Hazen is a workhorse of a brewer. From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com",

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

                    "description": "When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.",

The result is a malty, rich, full-bodied bock beer brewed with two-and six-row pale and specialty malts and two specialty hops. Like all Leinie's beers, Big Butt Doppelbock is handcrafted one batch at a time in our historic Chippewa Falls brewery.",

Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!",

Another key ingredient is hops, the variety used is particularly aromatic, giving a characteristic bitter aftertaste and a delicate fragrance to the beer.

Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia. Thanks for your support!",

The styles are (1) Black Beer (aka schwartzbier) originating from the former East Germany); (2) Rye Beer which at one time was only made in hardier areas of Eastern and Baltic Europe; and (3) Bock Beer which is widely known as a higher alcohol lager of Northern Germany. Our Black Rye Bock has a distinctive bitter chocolate palate and black color reminiscent of a black beer. The spiciness from the rye malt shines through in the flavor. The high alcohol balanced with malty sweetness rounds out this cold season bock. Smooth drinking with a punch makes this lager a perfect quaffer for our Arctic winter. 6.2% alcohol by volume.",

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.",

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

Mild Ale is a fine drinkin ale- it is meant to be consumed absolutely fresh- but it has by today's standards a very low ABV which has unfortunately is not as sexy as that 7.2% late hopped uberkool IPA everybody is talking about.  Thats fine.  Mild Ale don't care.  Guess What?  Dig on its tawny brown color!  Its subtle First Gold Hop note!  Herbs!  Caramel! Roast!  Yeast you can TASTE!  All in a 3.9% ABV package.  I tell you what.  If this doesn't catch on like it first did in the 17th Century I'll eat my rotary phone.  (note: I will not eat my phone)",

            "description": "Before the 1700's, Malting Barley was a hand-crafted, boutique process that produced inconsistent results. With the introduction of coke-fired kilns, Maltsters improved their control of the process to the point that light-colored or 'Pale' malts were now possible. These new products caught on in a big way, spawning new styles of beer including Porter, Mild, and Pale Ale. In England, the Pale Ale style was divided into several sub-styles including Extra Special Bitter, a classification typically reserved for Pale Ales brewed at over 4.8% ABV. \r\n\r\nAlthough Clandestine's 'Broken Bitters' checks in at around 5% ABV- putting it squarely in the strongest Bitter category- we think that it still qualifies as a 'Session Ale.' Well-hopped with the quintessential English partnership of East Kent Goldings and Fuggles, 'Broken Bitters' remains highly drinkable and refreshing. Based on a simple malt bill of Scottish floor-malted Golden Promise with a touch of Carastan, this is a beer brewed to style- clean & clear with a spicy, citrus hop aroma.",

            "description": "As Brooklynites, we revere the memory of the 1955 World Champion Dodgers baseball team, so we had to name a beer in their honor. Brooklyn Pennant Ale is a honey-colored pale ale with a brisk malt palate and finely balanced hop character. Pennant is a traditional English-style pale ale. The pale ale style developed in the early 19th century, and was called \u201cpale\u201d because it appeared so in comparison to the darker ale styles of the day (East India Pale Ale was a stronger, paler, more bitter version of the style). Brooklyn Pennant Ale is brewed from Scottish Maris Otter malt, which is justly prized for its toasty, biscuity flavor and the round smoothness it imparts to beer. Our house ale yeast brings out an appetizing fruitiness and ferments to a dry finish. During 2005, Brooklyn Brewery will donate one dollar from every case of Pennant sold to the funding of the statue of Brooklyn Dodgers greats Jackie Robinson and Pee-Wee Reese planned for the Cyclones ballpark in Coney Island.", 
            "foodPairings": "Brooklyn Pennant Ale is great with pizza, roasted and grilled meats, burgers, barbecue, robust fish, shellfish, falafel, crab cakes, and spicy food. Caramel malts lend it the ability to work nicely with steaks, but just as well with grilled vegetables. For cheese, pair up with Stilton and Gorgonzola Dolce.",

The only noticeable difference in these styles is the level of Hop presence. Buckin' Bitter is an Ordinary Style bitter.  Brewed with crystal and caramel malted barley this beer features moderate sweetness and a noticeable hop character. Slightly bitter with a bit of floral hop aroma this is a good introduction to the more robust English ale styles we brew.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

The art of brewing great beer in the US without a debilitating ABV had seemed all but dead. Not anymore. Myths are simply myths, and beers of great flavor and quality have been brewed for hundreds of years in every great brewing nation except ours. Chris is not out to change the US craft beer world, but to simply brew the beers he loves to drink, and he thinks he is not alone.\r\n\r\nChris has been brewing professionally since 1993, first as an apprentice at Kennebunkport Brewing, then at the Tremont Brewery in Boston MA starting in 1994. Today, Chris is an independent brewer \u2013 he owns no facility \u2013 instead brewing and collaborating with other breweries. He currently brews his beers at two locations, the Ipswich Ale Brewery (Bottles & Draft) and Kennebunkport Brewery (Cask).",

Chris is not out to change the US craft beer world, but to simply brew the beers he loves to drink, and he thinks he is not alone.\r\n\r\nChris has been brewing professionally since 1993, first as an apprentice at Kennebunkport Brewing, then at the Tremont Brewery in Boston MA starting in 1994. Today, Chris is an independent brewer \u2013 he owns no facility \u2013 instead brewing and collaborating with other breweries. He currently brews his beers at two locations, the Ipswich Ale Brewery (Bottles & Draft) and Kennebunkport Brewery (Cask).",

As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.",

We used standard English hops and a English style yeast to give this more of an authentic character, not a NW style bitter.

                    "description": "Uinta Brewing Company embarked upon its mission of brewing world class, full-flavored, craft-brewed beer in the winter of 1993. From a small, renovated mechanic\u2019s garage located in Salt Lake City, Uinta began distributing a tasty variety of beer ranging from 4.0% to over 10% alcohol by volume to local bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Demand escalated, resulting in the installation of a bottling line in 1996. Then, in 2001, having outgrown its original building, Uinta built and relocated to a 26,000-square-foot facility, specifically designed for brewing beer. \r\nUinta Brewing is named after an east-west mountain range located in northeastern Utah. Many of Uinta\u2019s beer names are inspired by Utah\u2019s diverse landscapes or have historical significance. Cutthroat Pale Ale, Uinta\u2019s flagship beer, is named after Utah\u2019s state fish. Subsequent beer names followed suit, such as King's Peak Porter, named after Utah\u2019s highest peak, Golden Spike Hefeweizen, named after the spike used to commemorate the completion of the transcontinental railroad in Utah, and Dubhe, named after the Utah Centennial star.\r\nIn desire of creating a different experience in beer, Uinta launched its Crooked Line in 2010. These beers were dubbed \u201cbig beers\u201d both in taste, alcohol content (ranging from 9 to over 13% alcohol by volume) and size of bottle.  Crooked Line beers are packaged in 750 ml bottles and are cork finished. Knowing that each beer was quite different from the next, it was essential that each brew showcased its individuality outside the bottle as well. Uinta sought the talents of local artists to design the labels, assuring that each style was unique in packaging as well as in style and taste. The launch of the Crooked Line was quickly followed by the grand opening of the Little Big Beer Store\u2014an on-site store selling higher alcohol content beers\u2014refrigerated!\r\nInspired by an upcoming 20th anniversary, Uinta Brewery sought a fresh approach in showcasing its products while maintaining the classic Uinta feel which reflects an appreciation for the outdoors and characteristics of the mountain west.  Uinta Brewing spent most of 2010-2011 going through a massive redesign of its logo, labels, all packaging and its bottle. The process enabled Uinta to clearly organize and define three lines of beers under the Uinta Family:  The Classic Line, Organic Line and Crooked Line. \r\nUinta designed a custom, proprietary 12 ounce bottle as part of the redesign project. Referred to as the \u201ccompass bottle,\u201d the new bottle shape is branded by a 360-degree compass embossed into the bottle\u2019s shoulder.  The upshot?  You\u2019ll never get lost with a Uinta bottle in hand!  Naturally, adopting the custom-shaped bottle gave rise to the need for a substantial investment in new bottling line equipment.\r\nThe redesigned logo embodies the uniqueness of the company\u2019s namesake, the Uinta Mountains.  A compass is integrated into the logo with the needle pointing East-West, referencing the only major range facing East-West in the continental U.S.. The compass also speaks to Uinta\u2019s sense of exploration and direction as Uinta consistently strives to brew the best beer possible. \u201cEarth, Wind and Beer\u201d remains part of the logo referring to Uinta\u2019s long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship. \r\nSince 2001 Uinta Brewing has been 100% wind-powered, becoming the first Utah company to reach this mark. In an effort to continue its commitment to using renewable resources, Uinta Brewing installed solar-electric paneling on the brewery\u2019s roof in 2011.  \r\n Uinta beers have received awards and medals from regional, national, and international competitions, including the North American Beer Awards, World Beer Cup, and Great American Beer Festival. \r\nUinta is committed to brewing world-class beer using the best practices and ingredients.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

Combining a 19th century recipe with 21st century ingredients, Gold Sovereign seeks to emulate the pale ales of the Victorian era using ingredients that have only become available in the last few years. The ultra-modern barley variety Westminster gets the traditional malting approach through organic cultivation and malting by hand on the floor. Highly disease and insect-resistant hedgerow hops were developed from classical varieties using time-honoured breeding techniques. These ingredients are combined with a unique English yeast to produce a refreshingly drinkable beer with a solid malt base and assertive character. Expect this unfiltered ale to have an aroma of pear, apricot and spicy orange, leading to a pronounced hop bitterness and malt flavour reminiscent of freshly baked bread.",

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).",

The aroma is malty with a hint of the noble German hops. Maltiness dominates the flavor, but with a very complex background of hop bitterness, floral yeast character and a very intriguing nutty quality. Very drinkable!",

Well, to make a long story short, my forefathers in Ireland had their hand in the brewing business and crafting beer casks when barrels were made out of wood.\r\n\r\nToday, my own family is in the business of making yeast that happens to also go into the making of beer. So, it was a natural for us to revive the brewery that has been in Lexington since 1794. Welcome and enjoy.",

Wormtown Punk Punk Press was gobbled up by the musicians and music fans of Worcester who craved news and information about the exciting sounds emanating from the local airwaves and rock clubs. Wormtown Punk Punk Press featured groups from Worcester like the Blue Moon Band and Crazy Jack, and from Boston like Willie Alexander, DMZ and The Real Kids. The 'zine hit a nerve in the city and those who were entranced with punk picked up on the name Wormtown and adopted it quickly to represent themselves and their emerging culture. Within a year an album showcasing the city's best punk bands entitled Wormtown '78 was produced, effectively branding the local music scene, and the city of Worcester, forever.\r\n\r\n?Not everyone identifies with Wormtown. Not everyone is involved with the underground music scene in the city, not everyone is a fan of punk. But the name has stuck and has been adopted by countless Worcester citizens because it symbolizes and embraces the free spirited do-it-yourself ethic that is simply Worcester. Over the years it has meant many things to many people and sometimes frowned upon as derogatory by some, when actually it helped change the culture of the city in a way where anyone could strike out on their own and create music, art or a collective of liked minded individuals. Wormtown Brewery has that same spirit - they are creating something unique to add to the mix in our city. Will it change Worcester the way music did back in the late '70s? Who knows. But one thing is for sure, there is nothing that goes better with good music than good beer.",

In short, to make outstanding beer.\r\n\r\nHow do we plan to do it? It involves using fresh, high-quality ingredients and a steady hand at the kettle. But that\u2019s just half of it. The other half of it is right here. The power of the internet, social media, and networking is here to see. Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.",

It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls. It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous \"Bavarian Beer Purity Law\" of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process. In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages, and 600,000 barrels of Hofbr\u00e4uhaus beer.",

In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!\r\n\r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly.\r\n\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

After several years of apprenticing with other master brewers, Mark was ready to begin crafting beer using his own recipes.\r\n\r\nHe found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA; a historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Mark re-opened the doors and introduced the Starr Hill Brewery. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its historic building with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall, and it was there that Mark's delicious craft beers became a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world. Nineteen prestigious awards later, Mark\u2019s brews continue to be a hit at beer and music festivals nationwide.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, in response to the growing demand, Mark moved from this small brewing operation to a larger brewing facility several miles outside of town, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's core and seasonal brews are now enjoyed in restaurants and music clubs throughout the Mid Atlantic and Southeast, and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores in the region.\r\n\r\nMark is proud of the awards his microbrews have earned, and the experts agree that he is among the best craft brewers in the country. But at the end of the day, what still matters most to Mark and his team of brewers at Starr Hill is giving people the gift of great beer.",

Piers has over 20 years experience in the brewing industry and is passionate to keep the traditions of Kent brewing alive. Using the best ingredients and the finest Kent hops, combined with the expertise and dedication of his brewing staff, Piers plans to build on the brewery's already growing reputation as the provider of some of the tastiest ales on the market.\r\n\r\nNow brewing from a seven and a half barrel kit and regularly having over a dozen ales of various strengths and taste available, the brewery is sure to have a beer to suit all!",

This beer was brewed using imported Maris Otter malt, which is a barley variety favored by British brewers for its superior flavor. A karmicaly balanced biscuity-bready malt beverage destined to deliver an English spicy character. With it's lower alcohol and clean crisp finish, Pilot Butte Bitter is the perfect lubricant to robust bordering on volcanic feasting with friends over a Smokehouse pizza. Take a vigorous walk or ride up nearby Pilot Butte cinder cone and reward yourself afterwards with a beverage fit for a king.",

In subsequent weeks, we will be expanding our offerings to include four additional beers, as well as two cask ales, which will complete our on-site brewing selection.\r\n\r\nLocated just off Main Street in Southbridge, we are within easy access to major routes I-84 and the Mass Pike. Parking for over 150 cars and handicapped accessible, we offer outside dining on our spacious patio overlooking the scenic Quinebaug River, multiple large flat screen televisions broadcasting the latest sporting events throughout the bar, gaming options that include championship dartboards and a pool table, and live entertainment on Saturday evenings. You can also look into our brewing area where all the magic happens and Tim would be happy to answer any and all questions and we welcome your suggestions for future offerings. We accept reservations to accommodate parties of 30-70 guests in our conference room that includes a private bar and optional catering.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that after experiencing our locally grown and freshly prepared food, our fantastic brew and the exceptional service of our dedicated staff, you will make Bentley Brewing and the Dark Horse Tavern your favorite destination spot. We look forward to welcoming you and your guests in person at our riverside location at 12 Crane Street.",

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

Even though this beer was retired almost six years ago, we still get numerous Tr\u00c3?\u00c2\u00b6egs old-schoolers (Martha) begging for its return.\n\nWell hang onto your boot straps because Scratch #11 is about as close as we can get to the original ESB without firing up the old brew kettle. The Scratch #11 recipe originates from Chris\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2 stint at England\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2s University of Sunderland brewing program. After returning to Colorado the brothers drew on Chris\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2 experience and brewed pilot batches tweaking that recipe. The ESB production recipe has direct bloodlines to these pilot batches.\n\nThe Thames Valley ale yeast and the roasted barley create a biscuit flavor with nutty undertones. Combining these flavors with the earthiness of East Kent Golding hops creates one hell of a fine session beer. Take in the deep mahogany beauty of this beer and breathe in the full hoppy nose. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2s not the ESB, but it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2s damn special.",

We are a family company born of a deep passion for beer and a great reverence for brewing history, tradition and culture. Our motto is Celebrating Beer. This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.). Baird Beer also is sold through a steadily expanding family of outside pubs, restaurants and liquor stores in Japan as well as being exported to select international markets. Consumer purchases of Baird Beer direct from the brewery are possible through our online estore (delivery only within Japan).",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

The aroma is full and malty, with a fresh but soft hop aroma. The palate is full but somewhat crisp, and rich with pale malt character. The hops serve only to hold up the malt. With 600 years of brewing behind it, Spaten never seems to disappoint. This is a classic German blond bock, suitable for any time of the year.",

Piers has over 20 years experience in the brewing industry and is passionate to keep the traditions of Kent brewing alive. Using the best ingredients and the finest Kent hops, combined with the expertise and dedication of his brewing staff, Piers plans to build on the brewery's already growing reputation as the provider of some of the tastiest ales on the market.\r\n\r\nNow brewing from a seven and a half barrel kit and regularly having over a dozen ales of various strengths and taste available, the brewery is sure to have a beer to suit all!",

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)",

Lion Nathan produced a beer the following year named Steinecker, named after the company whose equipment the beer was made in. The beer's name was changed in 1962, not in response to a challenge from the Steinecker company, but to distinguish it from Heineken.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 Steinlager was launched in the United States and an American consultant suggested that to become successful the company should change the colour of their bottles to match that of other premium beers. As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Our goal is to create outstanding beer, to have a low impact on the environment, and to create personal relationships and ties to the local community. \r\n \r\nWe have 7 owners and an extremely talented brewer - Conor Robinson. \r\n \r\nOur inspiration comes from the popular and innovative styles of the West Coast brewers and is fueled by Conor's Passion and ability to construct unique yet sessionable recipes.  We're excited to add to the growing craft beer movement in Charlotte and the Carolinas.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

It overlooks Cook Inlet, with the second highest tide in the world (38 feet) and the active industrial port of Anchorage. On clear days, North America's highest peak, Denali (Mt. McKinley) stands majestically to the north. To the west sits our brewery's namesake, Sleeping Lady (Mt. Susitna). Please join us for our fine hand crafted beers and Alaskan influenced entrees!\r\n\r\nThe Goose was one of the first Brew Pubs in Anchorage. We have won numerous national and international awards for our finely craft ales. Our dining room is sandwiched between our award winning brewery and our wonderful views to the north. Our upstairs Pub has two walls of windows extending the views. On a cold day, you can sit by a warm fireplace with a hot meal and a cool beer. Our two outdoor decks off of the Pub offer mountain views, radiant sunsets, military aerobatics, and an active port.",

Or you could be social and get out to your favorite local watering hole. If they don't have our beer on tap, let us know and we'll do our best to pester 'em into submission. Do we bottle?

It is no longer grown in the U.K. in significant amounts. In addition to being a good all-around bittering hop for German-style beers, it is the only hop used in Anchor's Steam Beer, and is often used in other beers of the same style. However, the American-grown versions are often considered inferior to the German for use as an aroma hop.",

We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",

With the closing of the Stark Mill Brewery and the many changes that have befell the city in the recent years, Peter felt that Manchester, as New Hampshire's Queen City, was sadly falling the way of commercial and contract beers. He, with a dedicated following of fans of his brew, set to work reopening the brewery as \"Milly's Tavern,\" proudly operating as Manchester's only brew pub. We welcome you as our guests to stop by and try a glass of Peter's hard work.",

At the tender age of 13 both knew what they wanted to do for a living... make and drink good beer.  Just kidding!!\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words \"Town Hall\" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.  Please come and taste our award winning beer and fantastic food.  Food and beverages are served in our bar, dining room and lounge.  Outdoor seating is available on our spacious patio from April 1 (weather permitting) until the snow flies in winter.",

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

Besides its two Pennsylvania facilities, Yuengling also operates a brewery in Tampa, Florida.\r\n\r\nThe family-owned brewery has traditionally changed ownership through the purchase of the company by the offspring of the previous owner.

Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Hop flavor and aroma character may be evident at the brewer's discretion. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character and very low diacetyl (butterscotch) character are acceptable in aroma and flavor, but should be minimized in this form of bitter. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",
