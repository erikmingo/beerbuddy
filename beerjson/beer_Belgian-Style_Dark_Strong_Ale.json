As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner. And now, she's our CEO.",

In 1997, a Fort Collins flood destroyed the original recipe our researcher, Phil Benstein, found in the library. So Phil and brewmaster, Peter Bouckaert, traveled to Belgium to retrieve this unique style lost to the ages. Their first challenge was deciphering antiquated script and outdated units of measurement, but trial and error (and many months of in-house sampling) culminated in 1554, a highly quaffable dark beer with a moderate body and mouthfeel.",

This year, the fest marks our first anniversary and 2011 also signifies 25 years of Max\u2019s. For this occasion we crafted an elegantly deep, dark ale that features elements of roast, light smokiness, and beautiful fruity esters attributed to the Belgian yeast strain used. Thanks for an amazing first year.",

They chose the name Cismontane because the geographical area it represents, coastal Southern California from Santa Barbara to San Diego. As a brewery we are dedicated to creating the finest beers to represent the unique culture and diverse natural aspects of this region. Each beer is named after a local feature that is unique to the area.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery is located on the side of the largest mountain in Orange County in the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. The great views from Santiago peak and the trails through the canyons provide some of the natural inspiration for the beers and the company.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small and accessible to all with a warm and comfortable tasting area. So don\u2019t hesitate to come by when in the area.\r\n\r\n(cis-mon-tane)\r\n\r\n\u201cThis side of the mountains\u201d, in reference to coastal Southern California.

It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8\u00b0\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026",

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.",

            "description": "To acknowledge this year\u2019s anniversary, our 11th, Allagash\u2019s brewers decided to use a champagne yeast for both the primary and secondary fermentations. This beer was brewed with both Cascade and Northern Brewer hops and copious amounts of Belgian Aromatic Malt to achieve its vibrant garnet color and unique, malty palate. At a hefty 9% ABV, the alcohol in this brew is balanced by a light sweetness, a full-bodied mouth feel and a gentle, lingering hop character. \r\n\r\nJust prior to bottling, when there is no carbonation present in the beer, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast is added. After bottling, the beer is aged in our temperature-controlled cellar, where the yeast ferments the sugar and naturally carbonates the beer. This process, known as m\u00e9thode champenoise, is the same traditional process we use for all of our bottled beers. \r\n\r\nThe batch of 11th Anniversary Ale was bottled in May of '06 - 950 cases, six bottles in each case and is the only batch that will be available. Its aroma is redolent of red licorice, nutmeg, wild apple, and hard candy. Its taste is malty with date and fig notes with a finish that is crisp, striking a balance between dry and fruity. We suggest serving this rustic brew at cellar temperature.",

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.",

From humble beginnings, brewing 800 barrels of three different beers in 1994, we have progressed to brewing 13,000 barrels of twenty different beers in 2007. We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.",

I want to do something that fits in between.\"\r\n\r\nThe dream for Buttera started when he was in college, and a friend turned him on to home brewing, which he has been doing now for about 13 years. Four years ago, his love of home brewing led him to open the Point Brew Supply, 1816 Post Road, Plover, with his wife, Katina.\r\n\r\n\"It (Point Brew Supply) has opened my eyes to all the different ingredients that I think a lot of brewers don't have exposure to,\" \"I've played with every single strain of yeast and grain and hop in there.\r\n\r\nO'so Brewing Co. is planning to have a varied lineup of beers, with interesting names and flavors. They will have a red ale, a West Coast Pale Ale showcasing American hops, as well as a Black Cocker Bock.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to show the world what I've learned, and I'm definitely not going to do things like other people are, but I think I'm on some sort of weird cutting edge.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has a capacity to brew about 280 gallons per batch, with plans to brew twice a week. A unique aspect of their marketing technique will be in the tapper. The design, a \"Big O\" will be the brewery's signature.",

We are one of the smallest breweries in North Carolina and also one of the smallest in the country. We have a 1.5 bbl brewhouse , 1 and 3 bbl fermentation tanks. Being so small we can afford to take more time and effort into our beers. We utilize many ingredients from all over the world, selecting only the finest grains, cultured yeast, fresh whole hops, and  our mountain water that is perfect for producing the best beers possible.  Another advantage of being small is that we can produce a wide variety of styles so our selection will always be changing. We will produce beers that fit the season and year round classics. Loe's Brewing takes pride in producing the finest handcrafted beers, and we are sure that once you try our beer you will agree that bigger is not always better , and will notice the difference that craft beer has to offer.

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

At the Bloomington Brewing Company, we make beers that we like to drink. That\u2019s the first rule. Great ingredients and attention to detail is the second. Our intention is not to grow a large brewery operation, our intention is to make great beer that we like to drink and to take care of our community.\r\n\r\nWe make only ales and they are available only on draft in Bloomington, Indianapolis and the surrounding communities. We do not bottle our beers. We\u2019re not against bottling, and we will assuredly reach a point in the future where we will package our beer, but no matter how good a beer is in the bottle, it can never be better than the beer coming from a well managed tap. Often it will be not nearly as good. Why? Draft beer is fresher; that\u2019s a big one. Packaging beer is a complicated process with lots of potential for bad things to happen. Once packaged, the beer is exposed to its two mortal enemies; Sunlight and time.",

The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived.

We decided to brew this beer with 100% imported Belgian malts and sugars which help give it a truly authentic character. This strong Belgian ale boasts a rich maltiness from its four specialty malts. The sweet malt is complemented and refined by the addition of Dark Belgian Candi syrup. The aroma is a pleasing mixture of the malt and spicy phenolics and esters from the Belgian Yeast. Warming alcohol notes in the finish help make this a beer to remember.\r\n\r\nOur 2012 Homebrew Competition winner was Jake MacDonald of Minnesota. Jake brought this wonderful beer literally \u201cCross Country\u201d to enter it into our competition. Our panel of judges were so impressed with the rich complexity of malt and sweetness balanced with the Belgian yeast aromatics that they unanimously selected it as the winner. We were also lucky enough to have Jake and his brother travel to California again to help us brew the full-scale batch.",

Having been to Belgium, we have to agree \u2013 we can lump some beers together by type, but Belgian brewing has a sort of wooly individuality that we admire. We are surely telling the truth if we say that British and Irish dark beers tend to be colored and flavored by roasted malts. And it\u2019s equally true to say that Belgian dark beers tend to be colored and flavored with caramelized sugar syrup, giving them a very different set of flavors from their cousins across the Channel.\r\nWell, it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. We love our Belgian yeasts and we also love stout, so you knew this would happen eventually. Brooklyn Cuv\u00e9e Noire starts with a solid base of German malts, builds color and flavor from British and American roasted malts, gains rum notes from Mauritius raw sugar, grabs a hint of citrus from sweet orange peel, and then ferments under the flag of Belgium. Our Belgian house yeast lends the beer a gentle spiciness on a dry, brisk palate displaying light notes of chocolate, coffee and citrus, all underneath a fluffy tan head. The finish is clean and dry. Cuv\u00e9e Noire is big enough to take a steak to dinner, roasty enough to love Mexican mol\u00e9 sauce, and complex enough to enjoy with nothing more than a good conversation.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the style thing, well, we\u2019ll all just have to relax about this one. I mean, we\u2019re not even sure that Belgium even has a government right now, and they don\u2019t seem to be worrying much about it. So have yourself a Brooklyn Cuv\u00e9e Noire. It\u2019s from Brooklyn, not Belgium. We don\u2019t have a king. Don\u2019t fence us in.",

The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived.

                    "description": "In 2007 Gordon Schuck\u2019s recipe design and brewing skills resulted in a gold medal-winning Saison at the National Homebrew Competition. Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nAmerican Eagle Distributing and C.R. Goodman\r\n \r\nNebraska:\r\nQuality Brands of Omaha and Double Eagle Beverage\r\n \r\nArizona:\r\nHensley Beverage Company",

In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world. It is always a place where good food is accompanied not only by our beers but by good music and by the sympathy of the staff who always has a smile for everyone and where it is customary to a friendly \"welcome\", a hello and a good day to all those who pass through it if only for a small beer refreshing.",

The neighborhood corner stores continue to add microbrews to their stock and it seems that a dynamite draft selection is essential to any new bar that opens. Restaurants regularly hold beer dinners featuring multi-course food and beer pairings and for seven days in the spring, during DC Beer Week, the number of beer-themed events can make the head spin. At a handful of downtown brewpubs the beer enthusiast can sample a variety of house made brews. What D.C. has not had in over 60 years, however, is a brewery whose product is available in local stores and on tap outside of its site of production.",

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.",

In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.",

For ideal tasting, serve cool at a recommended temperature of 7-8\u00b0 C and pour out gently in one movement.

Sweet, malty aroma with a satisfying balance of hoppiness. Tremendously intriguing, complex flavors play upon the palate shifting from sweet to tangy to hoppy and so on.

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied.

The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high.

What a street name for our dream brewery to be built!! \r\n\u200b\r\nWithout inspiration, we wouldn\u2019t be here to enrich our local community with world-class craft beer.  In honor of all things inspirational, we offer this very special Belgian Style Dark Strong Ale.  The deep ruby hue of this ale comes from the use of several English and Belgian crystal malts as well as a touch of roasted malt.  The rich malt character is balanced by a high ABV, a blend of highly attenuative and expressive Belgian yeast strains, and just the right amount of hops.",

In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world. It is always a place where good food is accompanied not only by our beers but by good music and by the sympathy of the staff who always has a smile for everyone and where it is customary to a friendly \"welcome\", a hello and a good day to all those who pass through it if only for a small beer refreshing.",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

A mixture of two-row pale malts, caramel malts, and special aromatic malts gives the Quad its richness and texture. The subtle hop flavor imparted from Brewer\u2019s Gold hops lingers in the background and provides just enough bitterness to balance the malt sweetness.  The addition of imported Belgian Dark Candi Syrup rounds out the beer, giving the Quad its full body and deep auburn color.  Expect notes of honeyed dry fruit with peppery phenols in the aroma, a velvet-like mouthfeel, and a superbly drinkable beer.",

By Northwest standards an 8.5% beer may not be considered strong, but it is currently the biggest beer Beetje produces. It pours dark brown, with shades of ruby and a creamy tan head. The flavor is dominated by caramel, and candy and offers a smooth finish. Chocolate and coffee begin to emerge as the beer warms.",

This milestone not only exemplifies their continuing commitment to amazing craft beer, but also signals a shift in focus for the brewery towards more innovative recipes and concepts.\r\n\r\nHeaded up by a small group of impassioned beer lovers including head brewer Garett Lockhart, Red Brick is determined to lead the charge in the south, putting out excellent beers such as \"Hoplanta\" IPA and the upcoming winter release \"Sacred Cow\" chai milk stout. They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects. After all, craft beer isn't just a product; it's a journey.",

The Brewery is located in just outside of Laurelton PA. We are a small production brewery using a one barrel brewing system. We hope to produce around 50 barrels a year. At present we are making 4 different styles of beer. A Wheat beer, Porter, Grand Cru, and Belgian Dubbel. All of our beer is unfiltered, and bottle conditioned. Our beers are now available at the Bull Run Inn, Market St., Lewisburg, The Beer Barn, Lewisburg and Wehr's Beverages, Mifflinburg.",

With our unique touches on classic styles and our constant efforts to innovate and lead craft brewing into new, uncharted territories, even the most discerning palates will find something they love. Two year-round offerings, four seasonals and a series of four big-bottle beers will make sure of that.\r\n\r\nThe City: Considered to be the epicenter of the American craft brewing resurgence, Portland, Oregon is home to more breweries than any other city in America. Portland Brewing was one of the first craft brewers in the city and created Portland\u2019s original Amber Ale. A favorite throughout the years, when Portlander\u2019s say \u201cGimme a Mac\u2019s\u201d it\u2019s understood they want the crisp, distinct flavor that MacTarnahan\u2019s Amber Ale is known for.",

                    "description": "In 1890 the Allard family founded the Brunehaut brewery in Guignies, then called the St Joseph Brewery. It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8\u00b0\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026",

We\u2019re passionate about fermentation and it shows in our brews. Whether it\u2019s a dry-hopped Northwest IPA or a malt-heavy Porter, the Prodigal Son is dedicated to exploring the possibilities of grain, hops and yeast. Creativity is something we value in our Ales and it\u2019s our goal to incorporate regional ingredients into beers that go beyond convention. Brewing to style is not our objective; we prefer to focus our explorations on the potential of beer.\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019re more than just brewing, we\u2019ve got good food to boot. The Prodigal Son features a menu that combines traditional pub fare with scratch cooking. Here you will find regional ingredients incorporated into handcrafted cuisine. We have a bona fide chef with an artist\u2019s muse- and his work is truly the product of inspiration. Our food is unique \u2013you might even say it has character.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to be back home, here in Eastern Oregon. Come visit anytime, and stay as long as you like. We hope you will join us on our journey to beervana. Lucky for you, your efforts will be rewarded with good beer.",

In the beginning we had only one ale, the Guldenberg, named after the Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, where beer was brewed in the past. With a history in the beer world (since 1930 the Bacelle - Noffels family was active in beer commerce and as a lemonade producer), Nino had started experimenting with brewing ale in 1981. After an education as brewer at the CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about this formula is that it\u2019s possible to brew profitable without big investments. The Deca brewery is Woesten was chosen to do this and in the first year 9000 litres of Guldenberg were brewed.",

Butchers, bakers, farmers and even brewers, made their products for local consumption.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2009, Draai Laag began as a way to introduce beer with creative flavors into the market, offering a bit of variety in a world of Pilsners, Pales Ales and Porters.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we use old world methods, such as bottle conditioning by aging our ales on lees.  We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.  For those who understand us, we thank you and hope you enjoy what we have to contribute.",

The use of Texas honey and a well attenuated body in the Belgian abbey tradition make this beer superbly drinkable despite its high alcohol content.",

There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.",

The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived.

Deep ruby reds highlight its dark color, and Belgian candi sugars add flavors of dark cherries and plums, complementing the subtle esters familiar to the style.",

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.",

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.",

            "description": "Allagash Brewing Company would like to introduce its Tenth Anniversary Ale, a special beer that celebrates 10 years of brewing artisanal Belgian Style ales. A unique interpretation of our flagship Allagash White, Tenth Anniversary is a blend of two different whites: a sweeter batch (brewed in February, 2005) and a drier batch (brewed in March, 2005). By blending the two batches, an additional complexity is imparted. Further complexity, most notably expressed by the delicate vanilla notes, was gained by aging some of the beer in new oak barrels. \r\n\r\nSimilar to our other ales, Tenth Anniversary is bottle conditioned. Just prior to bottling, a fresh dose of sugar and yeast was added to the \u2018still\u2019 beer (at this stage there is no carbonation present). After bottling, the beer was aged in the warm room, where the fresh dose of yeast ferments the sugar, and naturally carbonates the beer. \r\n\r\nThe batch of Tenth Anniversary was bottled in May of \u201905 (800 cases, six bottles in each case), and it is the only batch that will be available. Due to the unique brewing process of this special ale, it is important to store the bottle upright and serve it cold. The bottle should be chilled in a refrigerator for 12 hours, or in an ice bucket with water and ice for 30 minutes before serving.",

From humble beginnings, brewing 800 barrels of three different beers in 1994, we have progressed to brewing 13,000 barrels of twenty different beers in 2007. We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.",

We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019. We believe we have.",

            "description": "Thor was arguably the most loved, admired and feared of all the Norse gods.  We all know of his powers over thunder and lightning, but there is a story in the Poetic Edda that we feel is much more appropriate.  As the tale goes, Thor woke one morning to find his hammer, Mjolnir, missing.  With the assistance of Loki, Thor quickly discovered that his hammer had been stolen by Thrym, the king of a race of Giants, and that his only means of retrieval of Mjolnir, was to have Freya agree to become Thrym\u2019s wife.  Now while Freya was promiscuous, even she had her standards, and after refusing to take part in the exchange, Thor dressed in a bridal gown and veil and presented himself in the role of Freya.  Thrym bought in to the ruse, and upon presenting Mjolnir to Freya (secretly Thor) in the exchange, Thor threw off the veil and gown and destroyed the Giants en masse.  I guess what we are trying to say, is that behind our beer\u2019s thinly veiled and beautiful facade, lay a full bodied ale that can pack a punch!\r\n\r\nThor\u2019s Equinox \u2013 Belgian Strong Ale is a brew that is big in flavor without the chewy body holding you back from finishing the whole glass.  We have stepped back from the emphasis on yeasty phenols to showcase malt and a unique woody note in the finish, creating a beer that is still Belgian, yet can satisfy stout and strong porter lovers as well.",

            "description": "Considered the rarest beer in the world, \"Westy 12\" is brewed by Saint Sixtus Abbey (Sint Sixtus Abdij) in northwest Belgium; one of the seven Trappist monasteries producing beer. It has an ABV of 10.2% and uses the Westmalle yeast strain but all other details are speculation and the recipe is tightly guarded. The date stamped on the cap is a \"Best After\" date approximately three year after the day of production. The yellow cap is the only identifying mark of this beer as there is no label and they use three different bottles in production: plain, \"Trappisten,\" and \"Westmalle.\" The beer is not distributed anywhere in the world. The only way to acquire it is to visit the monastery.\r\n\r\nYoung bottles tend to be rather boozy, yet, the alcohol is never hot or harsh. Dried, dark fruit esters come through in the nose and taste and are accompanied by intense melanoidins. The characterful Westmalle yeast contributes to a doughy aroma, low bubble gum esters (think Juicy Fruit) and a hint of black licorice. A very complex beer which improves with age.",

It was founded in 1996 in San Marcos, California.\r\n\r\nStone Brewing is known for the aggressive Arrogant Bastard Ale, although the brewery considers Stone Pale Ale and Stone IPA to be its flagship beers. Most of their beers are characteristic of west-coast craft brews; that is to say, most beers have a traditionally 'hoppy' flavor. Stone beers are bottled in 22 ounce bottles, 12oz six packs, and occasionally 3 litre bottles.",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",
