The name for Blue Bee Cider is derived from a common name for one of Virginia\u2019s native bees, osmia lignaria, or the blue orchard bee. These hardworking bees are solitary and wild, emerging early in the cool spring just in time to pollinate apple blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt Blue Bee Cider, we aim to create balanced ciders true to their Virginia roots from a culinary perspective and true to the fruit from a cidermaking one. Each apple variety ferments differently, creating its own flavors which vary year to year depending on weather conditions. Blue Bee Ciders are never chapitalized (it\u2019s so sunny in the South, who needs to add sugar?) and never watered down. We use raw juice and ferment it straight off the press.",

Through their travels abroad, they took notice of the large presence of hard cider in bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Upon evaluating the disappointing landscape of hard cider in the United States, Ross and Tyler have made it their goal to build New England's first and largest craft hard cider company, and restore hard cider to its rightful place in American culture.\r\n\r\nDowneast Cider House currently produces one type of cider, Original Blend. The Original Blend is made from freshly pressed Maine apples because we believe in making the best product we possibly can, while also supporting local agriculture. We use Red Delicious, McIntosh, Cortland, and Gala apples in our cider. The Original Blend, currently packaged in kegs, is distributed through Pine State Trading Company (Northern Maine), Nappi Distributors.(Portland and Southern Maine), L. Knife & Sons (South Shore Mass), Seaboard Products (North Shore Mass), and Craft Brewers Guild (Mass minus north and south shores)",

The appealing lingering aftertaste makes Woodchuck Fall Cider the perfect beverage for a crisp, autumn day. Woodchuck Fall Cider will be available in limited markets during Autumn 2009.",
