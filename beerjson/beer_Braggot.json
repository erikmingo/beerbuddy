We're a draft beer only production brewery, which means that all we do is make beer and fill kegs. Sorry, no brewpub, but we do have a retail shop where you can pick up kegs to go, growlers, and perhaps get a taste of our newest beer before it's released. Or you could be social and get out to your favorite local watering hole. If they don't have our beer on tap, let us know and we'll do our best to pester 'em into submission. Do we bottle? Not yet but we never say never. Right now we're focused on doing one thing right... draft beer. Cheers!",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",
