The Company is owned by a group of passionate mates, locals to Balmain, with the following vision:\r\n\u2022 Becoming Sydney\u2019s own iconic local beer company, representing tradition, mates and pub culture\r\n\u2022 Brewing hand-crafted quality beer\r\n\u2022 Having the majority of pubs in Sydney pouring a Balmain Brewing Company beer\r\n\u2022 Re-opening the old Balmain Brewery of the 1980\u2019s as a Microbrewery/Restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe mates dreamed up the plan while drinking over the years in each of Balmain\u2019s 17 pubs, and hearing about the Balmain Brewery of last century and the 55 pubs of the 1800\u2019s! Over the last couple of years several beers have been launched \u2013 Balmain Pale Ale, Balmain Pilsner and Balmain Bock, as well as the recent launch of the Balmain Apple Cider. 2012 will see the introduction of a wider range of bottled beer and the planned opening of the Balmain Microbrewery/Restaurant.",

            "description": "The Balmain Pale Ale was launched in May 2010 in celebration of tradition, mates and pub culture. A distinctive full flavoured English\u2013style ale, the Balmain Pale Ale displays a rich malt character upfront which is derived from a blend of two base and three speciality malts. Used in conjunction\r\nthe result is a beautiful golden-copper colour with hints of sweet caramel on the palate. Malt is balanced with a mix of 3 complementary Hop varieties that give an assertive yet clean bitterness, along with an aroma providing hints of citrus hue and mild spice notes. The Balmain Pale Ale is all natural and unfiltered, and at 4.9% ABV, it\u2019s perfect to enjoy on its own or paired with your favourite local dish. Balmain Pale Ale is best enjoyed at 6-8\u00b0C to bring out the complexity and balance. It has been designed for the drinking pleasure and enjoyment of beer drinkers\r\nand critics alike.",

Harleys takes a traditional English Pale Ale and adds some specialty New Zealand hops and malt. Harleys is named after Nelson\u2019s early iconic brewer, (who became one of Nelson City\u2019s most eminent forefathers.) Not to be confused with the original Harleys brew, this new and improved beer creates a significantly different taste profile altogether. Enjoy a Harleys Pale Ale at local pubs and restaurants.",

The idea of opening up their own brewery was spawned in 2009 after long term home brewer Chris had had enough of the IT and corporate world took to convincing old school friend, Adam that it was more than just a great idea. After a number of 'research trips' to Western Australia, New Zealand and the U.S it was a good 12 months before the idea got off the ground and the reality of what was involved began to hit home. After a number of false starts and a marathon of bureaucratic hurdles  the current location was secured in 2012 and the real fun of setting up the brew house and taproom began. \r\n\r\nSix String Brewing company has in the short time its been open has with chris' brews and Adams sales expertise gone from strength to strength and hope to continue spreading word of the craft beer revolution happening across Australia starting with the Central Coast.",

But, really, in this day and age it seems you can\u2019t go and release a Pale Ale without having it loaded with hops \u2013 you\u2019ll be laughed out of the brewery. No chance here though; hops from the two countries give a heap of passionfruit, mango and citrus aromas. But it\u2019s not all in the head. While the beer has been designed to have a clean and dry finish, over the top of the malt you get the hop characters coming through again. That helps add bitterness which contributes to a refreshing beer that doesn\u2019t lack for flavour. The best way to sum up this beer? It\u2019s just feels really good to drink.",

Alexander Green, a convict in his own right, was appointed to the position of public executioner in 1828 and during 27 years hung over 490 people, including 6 women. He was instantly recognisable, having a livid scar down the side of his face \u2013 the result of an axe attack by a prisoner.

Being lovers of great food and beverage and local produce, the rich tapestry of McLaren Vale always delivered. As the boys got to know the wine community and gained a deeper understanding of the region, they realised there was a tremendous opportunity for a beer producer to add another dimension to the local offering. Beer has long been a popular post-work refreshment for the wine community and we like to think that behind every great wine is great beer.\r\nUs South Aussies are spoilt for choice when it comes to great food, beverage and produce. We have an appreciation for the good things in life, having grown up with such quality at our fingertips. This is the reason we started a beer company in this great state. We feel at home here and with that comes a responsibility to play a part in the great food and beverage offering.",
