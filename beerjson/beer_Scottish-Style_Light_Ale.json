No syrups, sugars or \"adjunct\" are used in our 100 percent grain mashes\u2014only barley and wheat malts, plus oatmeal in our special stout. All of our specialty malts are imported from the UK, as is our unique strain of yeast. The ales are naturally carbonated and left to settle or \"fine\" at cold temperatures, rather than being filtered. Filtration can remove much of the goodness from beer along with the haze. Another negative practice our Brewer avoids is pasteurization. Our natural and healthy brews are more lightly carbonated than the factory product, and served at a palatable 45 degrees F to bring out the fullness of the flavour for which we strive.",

Based on the satisfying malty ales of blustery Scotland, Brooklyn Winter Ale will have you looking on the bright side of things. Rich Scottish malts bring deep bready flavors to a beer with a full copper color, a round, smooth palate, and brisk hopping that pulls the sweet malts into balance. See - things are looking up already!",

And should you decide to enjoy a cigar in your favorite armchair in front of the fireplace, this beer will play along very nicely.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

The color will range from golden amber to deep brown Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

We are one of the smallest breweries in North Carolina and also one of the smallest in the country. We have a 1.5 bbl brewhouse , 1 and 3 bbl fermentation tanks. Being so small we can afford to take more time and effort into our beers. We utilize many ingredients from all over the world, selecting only the finest grains, cultured yeast, fresh whole hops, and  our mountain water that is perfect for producing the best beers possible.  Another advantage of being small is that we can produce a wide variety of styles so our selection will always be changing. We will produce beers that fit the season and year round classics. Loe's Brewing takes pride in producing the finest handcrafted beers, and we are sure that once you try our beer you will agree that bigger is not always better , and will notice the difference that craft beer has to offer.

We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.",

With our unique touches on classic styles and our constant efforts to innovate and lead craft brewing into new, uncharted territories, even the most discerning palates will find something they love. Two year-round offerings, four seasonals and a series of four big-bottle beers will make sure of that.\r\n\r\nThe City: Considered to be the epicenter of the American craft brewing resurgence, Portland, Oregon is home to more breweries than any other city in America.

We\u2019ve designed our brewery to allow for non-traditional brewing methods like decoction mashing, open fermentation, oak barrel aging, wild yeast strains and experimental hops.\r\n\r\nInitially, we\u2019ll only have a few thousand hectoliters of capacity. With added fermenters and bright beer tanks, we could push that to 11,000 hectoliters (or around 9,000 barrels). But we kinda like being small. It makes us nimble and free to experiment in ways that just aren\u2019t possible with larger batch sizes.\r\n\r\nHoused in a former transmission shop and mill supply store, Crux Fermentation Project was built by a community of beer lovers. To everyone who contributed ideas, materials, sweat and support, thank you. And cheers.",

After years of brewing and competing with each other for kudos in their local community, Mike Price and Jon Northup decided to join forces and produce the best beer that we\u2014using our combined brewing experience\u2014could produce.\r\n\r\nSaint Boniface is the name of the patron saint of brewers, the saint also associated with converting Germany to Christianity. St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done. The humble saint took an axe to the massive Thor Oak, which was sacred to the Saxons, in order to show them that his God was mightier than theirs. With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer \u201cpagans\u201d worshiping the false gods of the big beer industry and see that it is time to take a Boniface-like swing at converting some of those people to a better way of life, one full of rich, tasty, more satisfying brews.",

Despite its lightness, Scottish light ale will have a degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

Scottish Style Ale is our interpretation of the robust brews native to Scotland. Generous quantities of Pale malt along with Munich and Caramalts give this ale a deep and complex profile. Scottish Style Ale is just a shade darker than our Bitter, with a rich, slightly sweet first impression on the palate that rounds out to a satisfying maltiness and a medium-dry hop finish. At 6.3% ABV it's hearty but not overwhelming. Sure to please the Braveheart in all of us.",

Our selection of hand crafted lagers and ales are produced on premises using the finest grains and hops. We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite. Please let Bob or Donna, or any of the High Desert Brewing Co. staff know how you think we are doing.",

It offers an expansive view of the downtown Raleigh skyline. A wood post and beam pergola structure enclose the space and provides mottled shade without trapping sound, making conversation easy.",

Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah. There are now more than 12 thriving brew pubs in the state thanks to Schirf and the bill's sponsor, Senator Mike Demeitrick of Price, Utah.",
