There were years of home brew competitions, brew science classes, and extended beer runs thinly disguised as vacations. \r\nThe brewery went through an expansion starting in late 2008 and became operational in mid 2009. Four double sized fermentors were installed in an old garage behind the current brewery. A cold box was erected adjacent to the garage and a bottling machine with a nice labeler are housed there too.

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

It has been voted \"best beer\" in numerous New Orleans reader polls and is used frequently in recipes of great Louisiana chefs.\r\n\r\nBecause of its smooth, malty flavor, try it with smoked sausages, Louisiana boudin, or even with caviar. It\u2019s great with crawfish and Cajun food. You might also enjoy it paired with a spicy gumbo or tomato-based pasta sauce. It also goes well also with fried catfish dipped in a tart, lemony tartar sauce. Parmesan, Pecorino and Romano cheeses are good pairings with Abita Amber.",

Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

Restaurants regularly hold beer dinners featuring multi-course food and beer pairings and for seven days in the spring, during DC Beer Week, the number of beer-themed events can make the head spin. At a handful of downtown brewpubs the beer enthusiast can sample a variety of house made brews. What D.C. has not had in over 60 years, however, is a brewery whose product is available in local stores and on tap outside of its site of production.",

Approximately 10% of Ayinger beers are exported, mainly to Italy, the United States, and the rest of Europe. Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.",

Together with wheat beer this Muenchener Hell style is the most famous beer style in the Bavarian south. \r\n\r\nAs people in Bavaria are very demanding as far as their daily drink is concerned the brewers are very aware of the necessity to brew a yellow-golden beer with a light malt taste. It is crisp, smooth and mellow. A perfectly balanced taste and aroma. \r\n\r\nAyinger Lager Hell is often used for cooking and it can be paired with many typical Bavarian dishes like for example beef, pork and cold meat with radish and Brez\u2019n.",

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz\u2019s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.",

Well, if you've been living on Mars then you don't know that this beer is Named after the Mighty Carl, Patron Saint of many STL bars, and will only be on planet Earth for a short time.  The beer itself was brewed as a HellesBock which is simply a lighter colored, hoppyish-lager that is brewed to a stronger strength (Bock).  The Man himself is much harder to describe.  Some would say Charming.  Some would say Handsome and Debonair.  Some would even claim him to be Charitable, Friendly and Trustworthy.

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish. And for those of you with a sweet tooth we make a fantastic Root Beer!",

The modest facility (60,000 or so gallons a year) is located in the lower level of the DeliBakery (formerly the Austrian Tea Room), where draughts of the heavenly concoction will be available year round.",

Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary.

                    "description": "In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd met at a favorite local bottle\r\nshop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden.

Our publicly-held brewery employs over 150 people who are as passionate about quality craft beer as Kurt & Rob themselves.\r\n\r\nWe opened the brewery in 1984, and built a new 40-barrel brewing system in our current Russell Street location in 1990. We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

That means big, ornate beer. And why not? The best isn\u2019t always for everyone!\r\n\r\nWe are a family-owned business. Under the guidance of master brewer and construction engineer Aubrey Hall, our family has pulled together to make something special",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.",

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

That\u2019s why she asked young Benjamin Fordham to start a brewery in the new port of Annapolis. Benjamin\u2019s passion and dedication to making the highest quality brews were evident in every pint and the colony flourished!\r\n\r\nAlmost 300 years later, Fordham brewing was re-born in the heart of Annapolis in 1995.  With the ever-increasing demand, this frothing Fordham giant was more than our small brewery could handle. In an effort to provide more people with our brews, our plucky staff grabbed our recipes and moved Fordham to its new castle in Dover, Delaware\u2026a brand new stainless steel castle of opportunity!\r\n\r\nDespite geographical changes, our brewery is happy and healthy in Dover, and more productive than ever before. Fordham Brewing remains true to its roots, its recipes and Annapolis heritage.",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.",

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors and was sold to other Cincinnati interests when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Company, the last remaining Cincinnati brewery. The lager of this era was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of further sales that took the business out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati, OH by its current local ownership. A brewery/gastropub has been opened on the Cincinnati riverfront and a major production facility is expanding in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district.  The company also owns the Hudepohl, Burger and Schoenling brands.",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

Penn\u2019s flagship lineup features authentic German-style beers brewed in the tradition of Pittsburgh\u2019s German immigrants, according to the strict quality standards of Reinheitsgebot.  \r\nMore recently, our lineup has been expanded to include other varieties including APAs, IPAs, fruit beers, and more.  The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

                    "description": "In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd met at a favorite local bottle\r\nshop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.",

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

            "description": "This light style lager originates from the Munich region of Southern Germany.  It was originally created in the 1800's to compete with the ever growing popularity of the Czeck style pilsners.  It is light bodied with a very slightly sweet malt overtone.  The use of German Noble hops is noticeable but takes a back seat to the light malt flavors.  As it is a lager style yeast, this beer ferments at cool temperatures and lagers or matures at temperatures just above freezing.  The lager yeast and maturation at low temperatures gives this beer a clean and refreshing character, making it a perfect thirst quencher.  The lower alcohol content makes it a very easy drinking session style beer for any occasion.",

Our true-to-style lager is deep golden in color with a pleasant, malty aroma balanced by a rich, smooth flavor. We use only authentic Moravian and German malts as well as Bavarian lager yeast strain to create this smooth and flavorful brew.\r\nCool fermented and aged for six weeks, this beer is made to be delicate yet still hearty. Hooker Munich Lager is great anytime of year but particularly refreshing in the summer.",

                    "description": "When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

Penn\u2019s flagship lineup features authentic German-style beers brewed in the tradition of Pittsburgh\u2019s German immigrants, according to the strict quality standards of Reinheitsgebot.  \r\nMore recently, our lineup has been expanded to include other varieties including APAs, IPAs, fruit beers, and more.  The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

A group of businessmen incorporated Shiner Brewing Association and placed Herman Weiss in as the company's first brewmaster. In 1914 a German immigrant brewer named Kosmas (or Kosmos) Spoetzl co-leased with Oswald Petzold with an option to buy in 1915. Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.",

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.",

It is a medium-bodied, malt-emphasized beer with malt character often balanced with low levels of yeast produced sulfur compounds (character). Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze.",

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits. Perhaps during your visit with us, you\u2019ll encounter the unexpected.",
