This first beer specially brewed for the winter season was christened Erdinger Schneewei\u00dfe.\r\n\r\nSlightly darker and stronger than classic Erdinger Weissbier \"with fine yeast\", our new \"Schneewei\u00dfe\" wheat beer is a welcome change during the cold winter months - the perfect time for a little indulgence!\r\n\r\nErdinger Schneewei\u00dfe uses the first malts from the summer harvest. It's not until mid October that the wheat beer specialty develops its amber color and spicy flavor - a result of its long maturing period. \"Schneewei\u00dfe\" goes particularly well with hearty food - something not uncommon during the Christmas season!\r\n\r\nThe seasonal beer is available from November to February.",

The Flat Rock Brew Cafe is home to a working 'nano-brewery' and a member of the Craft Beer Industry Association. The brewhouse itself consists of a Braumeister system, one very familiar to home brewers. German made, it provides efficiency in the brewing process and was selected for its compact design. For those who want to really explore the world of beer, we offer unique beer tasting events and brewery tours.\r\n \r\nSomething that is important to us is supporting the local community and since opening, we have been involved in many fund raising events for a number of local schools and businesses. We have also become the venue of choice for community meetings from sporting clubs to pre-schools.\r\n \r\nOur great range of wines and ciders are mostly Australian as we aim to support local producers.\r\n \r\nOur food is highly regarded and compliments our range of beverages. From share plates to weekly curry specials, there's always something for everyone including vegetarian and gluten-free options.\r\n \r\nWe truly appreciate the support you have all given us since opening and we look forward to seeing you here at Flat Rock Brew Cafe in the near future.",

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).",

The unfiltered beer has the characteristic clove and banana flavors familiar to HefeWeizen drinkers but with a darker and richer roasty malt character that is typical of some German-style Bock beers.

Here is a little rundown about what Fifty West is all about:\r\n\r\nAll the beers brewed at Fifty West Brewing Company have been hand made in small batches with a focus on craftsmanship, tradition, innovation, and patience.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why we selected the name \u2018Fifty West\u2019; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California. \r\n\r\nThe brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http://www.cincinnati.com/dining/heritage/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today\u2014amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement.\r\n\r\nTo us, it\u2019s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.",

Approximately 10% of Ayinger beers are exported, mainly to Italy, the United States, and the rest of Europe. Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.",
