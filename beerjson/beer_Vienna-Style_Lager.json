Low temperature fermentations create fewer \u201cyeasty\u201d aromas, esters, and flavors that are so common in ales.  We brew lagers because we enjoy their smooth malty and hoppy character.",

The lowest alcohol version was called Abzug, which means \"discount\" or \"reduction\" in German. These beers were the Austrian version of session beers. Our version tips the scales at 3.75% alcohol by volume. It's crisp, refreshing, with a nice floral Saaz hop nose, a malty palate, and a clean finish. This is the beer we brew for the wineries during harvest, but it's available to everyone. (1.013 BG, 3.75%, 26 IBU, 7 SRM)",

This colouring is a result of the type of malt used in brewing. Its alcohol content is 4.6% alcohol by volume, a percentage that makes it ideal for any time of day. In fact, it is not a strong beer and is therefore perfect for drinking at lunch, at dinner or for evenings out with friends.",

Blending Caramel Pilsen malts with 2-Row and Pale Ale malts, this European-style pilsner is modestly hopped with Perle, Czech Saaz, and Mt. Hood hops, giving it a slight North American essence. We culture only the finest California-style lager yeast and ferment at a slightly lower temperature to create a snappy hop flavour with a clean, dry finish. Finally, a real lager for the beer nerd in all of us!",

Lager beer in the \u201cVienna\u201d style was one of the local favorites. It is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt  center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop  aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by \u201cdry-hopping\u201d, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we\u2019ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.", 
            "foodPairings": "From the most modest picnics to the country\u2019s finest restaurants, Brooklyn Lager is enjoyed with everything from salads to steaks. Brooklyn Lager is at home with pizza, burgers, Mexican food, roast chicken, barbecue, fried fish, pork and Chinese dishes. For cheese, go with manchego, farmhouse cheddar and mild Gruyere.",

Shmaltz is known for blurring beer styles and using puns, art, history, and pop culture in every aspect of its products. Starting out as a contract brewer, third-party brewers produce their lineup using Shmaltz Brewing Company's proprietary recipes. In 2013, Shmaltz was \u201creborn\u201d in Clifton Park, NY, opening its own 50-barrel brewhouse in a 20,000 square foot warehouse just north of the Capitol district. Taking over 100% of their production meant bringing in the Brewmaster, Paul McErlean who designed every one of their award winning recipes, as well as Bob Craven, General Manager, and two of the experienced contract brewers. Shmaltz Brewing now has a true \"home\" for its family of fermented offerings and a tasting room for fans and curious beer lovers to come join the tribe. L'Chaim!",

In keeping with the Bavarian tradition of Oktoberfest, this beer is an Amber Lager made with traditional malts. Since we are in the wine country, we also add a small amount of grapes to each batch. They say \"It takes a lot of great beer at harvest time to make great wine.\" It\u2019s appropriate for Napa Smith to use grapes in one of their beers, since they also run a winery.",

In 2012, we made Idaho brewing history when we introduced Payette Pale Ale and Mutton Buster in cans. Be on the lookout for even more choices of canned beer in the future. In the meantime, you can find our beer in bars, restaurants, and retail locations including grocery and specialty stores throughout Idaho.\r\n\r\nWe chose the name Payette because it fits the way we live and work. Francois Payette was a French Canadian trapper whose name and memory is enshrined among numerous Idaho landmarks.

(How\u2019s that for some Freudian Slips?)\r\n\r\nBut seriously, it is brewed with German malted barley, European noble hops and lagered for two months. Enjoy.",

After conditioning ceases, we implement a process known as lagering, during which the beer is held at near-freezing temperatures to bring out its smooth elegant toasty malt flavor. It's a tad darker than your usual lager yet well balanced, giving you a savory enjoyable experience. Raise a glass of Great South Bay Lager... To Tradition!",

Hopfenmalz was part of the Anniversary Draft Series, a collection of eight single batch, limited release brews which took place over the past two years. Fans were asked to go online and vote for their favorite in the series, with the winner becoming the commemorative beer for the sesquicentennial year. The votes are in, and the fans have spoken. So join us as we raise a glass and celebrate 150 years of brewing history with Schell\u2019s Hopfenmalz! Prosit!\r\n\r\nHopfenmalz incorporates the elegant drinkability of a Pilsner, the bready maltiness of a Vienna Lager, and the hopping of a Pale Ale. The malty backbone is beautifully balanced by a bright, citrusy hop aroma and bitterness. Then we lagered it for an extended period of time to give it a crisp, dry finish.",

Imported Munich malts give our original flagship the deep bronze color and crisp toasted malt flavors of a Vienna-style lager, while Cascade hops and our proprietary yeast strain lend a smooth body and clean finish. Brewed in small batches since 1989, Karl Strauss Amber remains San Diego\u2019s original session beer.\r\n\r\nKarl spent his life making beer. He believed that behind every beer recipe was an inspiration, and behind every pint was a story waiting to be told. Karl Strauss Amber was his story, a story that challenged and inspired a new generation of brewers. Today we brew our own stories, while raising a pint to the man and the beer that started it all.",

            "description": "Love Rock is a Vienna Style Lager. This type of lager beer has a subtle malt sweetness, balanced by the earthy tones of noble German Hallertauer hops.\r\n\r\nThe Rock is a story unique to Milwaukee and our freshwater coast. As part of the drinking water system for the city, the system draws from a big pipe in the Lake. The \u201cintake\u201d was marked by a big structure that was prominent off the Bradford Beach shoreline. Because of the privacy (in plain view!)the Rock was a popular lookout point for ambitious suitors. In the exciting free love days of the early \u201970\u2032s, a few ambitious Milwaukeeans paddled out to the Rock and memorialized the sentiment of the time.\r\n\r\nThe original version of Love Rock known as \u201cWinter Lager\u201d happens to be the second batch of beer brewer at our second street location, it was brewed on November 27th 2007. We have made a few adjustments to the recipe over the years, just to the body and to the color. The Love Rock is Milwaukee Brewing\u2019s first year round production lager. The cold, long fermentation process that helps create such a smooth flavor. This recipe is pretty straight forward with the malts and two hop varieties. The Vienna style malt adds a nice toasty quality without overwhelming the beer. Our yeast guy tells us that this lager strain happens to be quite old. Many of the the major breweries in Milwaukee did, and still do, use this yeast. Love Rock is a refreshing and simple beer.",

Penn\u2019s flagship lineup features authentic German-style beers brewed in the tradition of Pittsburgh\u2019s German immigrants, according to the strict quality standards of Reinheitsgebot.  \r\nMore recently, our lineup has been expanded to include other varieties including APAs, IPAs, fruit beers, and more.  The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.",

The founder and driving force of High Point is award-winning homebrewer, Greg Zaccardi. After working as a brewer in southern Germany, Greg returned to the US to open his brewery.\r\n\r\nRamstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.\r\n\r\nGreg found a special brewer\u2019s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point\u2019s careful and proper brewing methods.\r\n\r\nThe name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.\r\n\r\nToday High Point Brewing Company expanded beyond wheat beers and brews 11 different wheat beers and lagers.",

Legend has it that water from the well had miraculous and curative properties, and people wold come from afar to drink from it.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery has combined modern technology with age old tradition in forming classic beer styles including lager, ale, stout, and wheat beer. All of the beers brewed at the Franciscan Well are natural, unlike some commercial beers that can contain chemical additives, preservatives and cheaper ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe Brewpub houses three serving vessels located directly behind the bar, which dispense our beer to the taps. The tanks, which hold 300gl each, offer the beer drinker a unique setting in which to enjoy our craft brewed beer.",

In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.",

While each rendition may have some truth to it, what it really boils down to is quite simple: Beer is fun. Brewing is fun. Drinking beer with your buddies is fun. So, why not a name that\u2019s fun? After all, we\u2019re in the business of helping people enjoy life. And we take our business very seriously. Our beers are craft-brewed for Old World taste and new world refreshment. Savored, slammed or sipped,these beers are also brewed to be sold and we plan on selling a lot of them. Aggressive marketing campaigns are in place to make sure Horny Goat Beers are on the radar of beer purchasers in select markets. Radio commercials, point-of-sale, guerilla tactics, swag, social media, you name it \u2018cause we plan on growing, and growing large quickly. Kind of like a horny goat.

They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer \u2013 Scott Vincent \u2013 leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.",

A long tradition that all the German brewers still obey to: In 1165 the first fine for serving bad beer was imposed in Augsburg. From 1487 onwards every brewer in Munich had to confirm on an oath to the ducal Rentmeister of Upper Bavaria, stating that he would not use any ingredients but barley, hops, and water to brew beer. Originally, this oath was valid in Munich only. In 1987 it was renewed by the Munich brewers.",

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.",

Stephen was in Europe doing research in molecular biology and experienced its beer culture that lead to his mid-career crisis.  He started writing about beer, and then tried to open a brewery in Arlon, Belgium but that faltered.  He then formed the first beer-of-the-month club in Europe, Beer Around the World.  Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU.  One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere.  Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world. He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland.   One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme.  It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven.  The new company was registered in Baltimore and the new beer was eventually produced in Nagold, Germany and called in honor of Baltimore's Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Special Lager.",

With a shot of Woodford Reserve chased with chilled Raven is a near perfect combination. The rich golden colored beer is an exceptionally smooth Southern German lager, somewhat malty but well balanced between the hops and malt.  Experiencing the clean finish and pleasant lingering aftertaste of The Raven Special Lager, one can truly say that The Taste Is Poetic.",

There was an influx of immigrant brewers to Mexico in the 19th century and Vienna Lager was a fave of Maximilian I during his wing-ding there according to all things internet. This lager style is very robust in flavor as a result of its namesake malt (vienna) which is roughly the color of Pale malt.  These beers are typically decoction mashed which is a time honored method for lager brewing in Germany but we have an infusion mash tun, so guess what?  I think our mash tun did a pretty good job.  Copper colored, Hallertau hopped, clean, bready, nutty, and 4.4%.  Thank the city of Vienna next time you're there.",

Camusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.\r\n\r\nLocated in Chico, California, Sierra Nevada Brewing is one of the most popular craft breweries currently operating in the United States. Its Pale Ale is world renowned, and the brewery produces almost 700,000 barrels of beer per year. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.",

This all malt, Vienna-style lager begins with our own crystal clear water \u2013 run through our state of the art filtration system \u2013 which is treated to mimic the waters of Bavaria, before being mashed with the finest malts from one of the oldest German maltsters.  Using traditional techniques, we craft this lager\u2019s wort in our four vessel brewhouse, transferring it to our fermenters to settle in for the long haul that all true lagers must undergo.  Our European lager strain ferments very cold and slow, leaving a crisp, clean, highly quaffable, light copper colored beer.  While most of our beers are unfiltered, we feel it is vitally important to filter this delicate beer, allowing the drinker to appreciate the clean, subtle complexities of a truly world-class lager.",

Its owners, the husband-and-wife team of Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop, have lived near Northwood since their purchase of a nearby farmhouse and acreage in 1998. Nebraska natives, Peter and Margaret lived and worked in Minneapolis for many years before moving to Worth County, where Peter\u2019s grandparents had lived and farmed and where Peter had spent much time as a boy.\r\n\r\n Having already established Margaret\u2019s engineering business in downtown Northwood, the couple turned next to Peter\u2019s passion \u2013 brewing great beer. For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way. He\u2019s a BJCP National Beer Judge, has brewed professionally with Summit Brewing Company of St. Paul, Minn., and worked on staff at one of the country\u2019s most popular brewing supply shops.\r\n\r\nWorth Brewing Company is Peter and Margaret\u2019s way of helping to reintroduce a great tradition \u2013 the locally owned brewery serving hand-crafted, high-quality, distinctive beers for the enjoyment of locals and lucky visitors. The nation\u2019s small and mid-sized towns were once dotted with such breweries. Today, Worth Brewing \u2013 perhaps one of the world\u2019s smallest craft brewers \u2013 brings a bit of those days back to delight the growing number of those who appreciate fine, locally brewed beers.",

We are one of the smallest breweries in North Carolina and also one of the smallest in the country. We have a 1.5 bbl brewhouse , 1 and 3 bbl fermentation tanks. Being so small we can afford to take more time and effort into our beers. We utilize many ingredients from all over the world, selecting only the finest grains, cultured yeast, fresh whole hops, and  our mountain water that is perfect for producing the best beers possible.  Another advantage of being small is that we can produce a wide variety of styles so our selection will always be changing. We will produce beers that fit the season and year round classics. Loe's Brewing takes pride in producing the finest handcrafted beers, and we are sure that once you try our beer you will agree that bigger is not always better , and will notice the difference that craft beer has to offer.

The air seems crisper and the snow covers the landscape like an natural gift-wrapping.  There's just no other place like it.  And that's the feeling that first inspired Winterfest.\r\n\r\nWinterfest was originally brewed in small batches for families and friends.  But the more it was shared, the more popular it became.  Soon the secret was out and Winterfest quickly became a cColorado holiday favorite.  Twenty-four years alter, Winterfest is still a labor of love.\r\n\r\nWe began brewing Winterfest exclusively for our friends in Colorado during September in anticipation of the holiday season.  We brewed a limited quantity to ensure the highest quality and freshness, which is represented by a unique \"limited edition\" number on each bottle.\r\n\r\nTo develop the distinctive characteristics of this outstanding winter lager, we combined our prized Moravian two-row barley malt with choice hops from the Hallertau region of Germany.  After brewing, we chill-lagered Winterfest at 1\u00b0 Celsius, to produce a perfectly balanced seasonal lager with an exceptionally crisp, clean finish.\r\n\r\nWe recommend you pour Winterfest into a glass, creating a two-inch head in order to fully appreciate its complex bouquet and flavor.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of seasonal beers to choose from, but there's only one that's become a true holiday tradition in Colorado.  Born and brewed in Golden, Winterfest is a hearty, hand-crafted winter lager worthy of this very special season in Colorado.  So from all of us at AC Golden Brewing Company \u2013 Happy Holidays!",

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",
