This beer is big on malt, big on hops, and big on alcohol content. It can be enjoyed now and is also designed to age. Traditional Barley Wines are at their best between four months and six years.

Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by the perception of low to medium bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor may be minimal to medium. English type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. Caramel and some characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, may be considered positive. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

Huge syrupy flavors flow over caramel, toffee, molasses and toasty notes. All these rich malt flavors are balanced out nicely by just the right amount of citrus-like hoppy bitterness. A high alcohol content makes this a beer for the cellar. As this brew ages, it will continue to develop more sherry-like flavors and aromas similar to a cask-aged port.\r\n\r\nThis is a BIG beer. True to our original vision, we have taken a traditional style and tweaked it a bit. Delicious on its own, Cereal Killer is also brilliant with many foods, or as a digestif.\r\nRecommended Foods: Limburger or Stilton Cheese, Wild Game, Baked Ham with Brown Sugar",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

Beejay Oslon and Gerrit Lewis met while working at Chicago's famous West Lakeview Liquors, a haven for beer geeks in search of new and exciting brews from around the world. While working there, the two got to thinking it was time to turn their passion in to a business.\r\n\r\n The first steps in that long journey  took them to a the small town of Lo in the Belgian countryside. It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery. While working there the boys honed their craft, learned the ins and outs of running a brewery, and had the opportunity to create their first commercially available beers. The success of these brews fueled their passion and prepared them for the work ahead of them.\r\n\r\n Upon coming back to the States the two began experimenting with pilot batches, formulating a business plan, and developing an image for Pipeworks.\r\n\r\n Now we are ready to bring what we've learned to the craft beer world!",

The original house was located under what is now the lobby of the Marriott Hotel. Built in 1908 as a private residence for the Hamilton family, over the years it served as the University president\u2019s house, a boarding house and home to several fraternities. The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson. We started with three beers; Tucson Blonde, Red Cat Amber and Copperhead Pale Ale, all still brewed today and joined by five other styles.",

All the ales have nautical themed names to gel with the surroundings in which it is brewed\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003 the brewery was bought and renamed the Nelson Brewing Company to fall in line with the most famous naval hero of all time 'Admiral Horatio Nelson' and that his flagship 'The Victory' was built here in Chatham Dockyard.\r\n\r\nIn July 2006 the brewery was purchased by Piers Macdonald. Piers has over 20 years experience in the brewing industry and is passionate to keep the traditions of Kent brewing alive. Using the best ingredients and the finest Kent hops, combined with the expertise and dedication of his brewing staff, Piers plans to build on the brewery's already growing reputation as the provider of some of the tastiest ales on the market.\r\n\r\nNow brewing from a seven and a half barrel kit and regularly having over a dozen ales of various strengths and taste available, the brewery is sure to have a beer to suit all!",

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.",

            "description": "The malty sweetness, fruitiness, unique hop aroma and high original gravity of Old Foghorn\u00ae Barleywine Style Ale is to beer much as port is to wine.\r\n\r\nOld Foghorn\u00ae is brewed based on traditional English barleywine methods. It is highly hopped, fermented with a true top-fermenting ale yeast, carbonated by a natural process called \"bunging\" to produce champagne-like bubbles, and dry-hopped with additional Cascade hops while it ages in our cellars. Made only from \u201cfirst wort,\u201d the rich first runnings of an all-malt mash, three mashes are required to produce just one barleywine brew.\r\n\r\nIntroduced in 1975, Old Foghorn\u00ae Ale was the first modern American barleywine sparking renewed interest domestically and in Britain. The name was derived from the English tradition of attaching the word \u201cold\u201d to barleywines to denote their tradition, intensive brewing process and cellar aging, and \u201cFoghorn\u201d gave it a San Francisco flair. Today, Old Foghorn\u00ae Ale is best enjoyed sipped after a meal.",

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

With this one, we are recommending aging it. It should age for 5 to 10 years. This is best done cold. DR10 is a big, strong, spicy barleywine with malt and alcohol dominating and a pleasant hop finish. The aroma has malt and spice from the alcohol. It was brewed with 6 different malts plus brown sugar. Columbus hops were used for bittering and it was finished with US Goldings. It had a very high level of attenuation for this style of beer which is why the aging is so important.",

From humble beginnings, brewing 800 barrels of three different beers in 1994, we have progressed to brewing 13,000 barrels of twenty different beers in 2007. We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.",

The oak is very apparent in this rich and high gravity ale, adding additional depth and complexity with a woody and cask-like nose and a pronounced vanilla flavor on the palate. With the addition of a more roasted malt in 2007, Samaels now delivers subtle bitterness to add balance to the natural sweetness. Cellarable for 10+ years.\r\n\r\nSamaels is the second installment of \u201cThe Demons of Ale\u201d series.",

Considered the strongest ale offered by breweries, our English Barleywine highlights a malty richness which is balanced with subdued esters of prune, raisin, and date characteristics. The intense malty caramel-like aroma entangles perfection with our noble hop selection. This full bodied beer is fairly high on alcohol; however its presence is overcome by the multi-layered complexity of our selection of malts. Oak aged versions will yield more depth of character with a slight hint of vanilla obtained during the aging process.", 
            "foodPairings": "Due to the nature of barleywines, often the intense character overpowers most main dishes therefore it best paired with desserts or strong cheeses. Rich desserts like chocolate hazelnut torte, or caramel cheesecake are a good pairing. Stilton cheese and walnuts are another great supportive food.",

With its\u2019 coating, silky rich mouth-feel, and complex interplay of deep caramel malt, ripe fruit aroma and sturdy alcohol, 7 Seas 2011 Barley Wine is a colossal, yet refined brew, perhaps best savored in the Ultimate Proper \u2018Brandy\u2019 glass, cheers!f",

                    "description": "After years of careful planning  and mortgaging everything  the Flat Earth Brewing Company was brought to life in 2007 by head brewer Jeff Williamson and his wife Cathie. In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.",

We boiled for over two hours to caramelize some of the sugars. The final product is as smooth as freshly resurfaced ice with a subtle hop character. This beer pairs nicely with calamari, ham and quail. Enjoy this beer with someone special on a cold winter's night. Get cozy by a roaring fire, and take time to reflect on how each beer is as unique as a snowflake.",
