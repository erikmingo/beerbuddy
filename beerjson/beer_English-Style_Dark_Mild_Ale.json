The original practice of small breweries supplying their immediate community has been nearly lost, and with it, the quality that is possible from small handcrafted batches. Our beers are built on old world English and Belgian recipes, but enhanced to celebrate bold domestic ingredients. Made with Austin\u2019s mineral rich water, the (512) beers taste like none other.",

All of Shaun's beers are produced using only natural ingredients, most of which are supplied by Best Mates Brewery, Ardington and Ken Thomas of Arkwright's Homebrew in Highworth, near Swindon, Wiltshire www.arkwrightshomebrew.com.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Shaun still has a full-time job.  Despite the restrictions placed upon Shaun in terms of both time and space, you can see from the photographs just how much can be achieved in a small, basic garage.

This classically brewed beer is a tad sweeter than its pale pilsner cousins and a natural complement to a good Irish Stew or other full-bodied fare. The ideal match is most pub grub like fish and chips or steak and kidney pie",

There\u2019s even a hint of coffee for that roasted dry element your palate craves. The Mild is best enjoyed fresh and prides itself as a low-alcohol session beer. Its dark facade and nutty finish provide an allure that is truly one of a kind. Our mild is well-suited for draught and cask conditioning. Hungry?

Since then, sales have grown steadily and the range of beers has increased.\r\n\r\nAcorn Brewery has developed a popular Yorkshire brand and is currently supplying over 300 free trade outlets and 3 national wholesalers.  \r\n\r\nThere are currently three award-winning beers permanently available, as well as regular seasonal brews.",

I had always liked my beer, but I realized that there tends to be a brewer\u2019s bias towards their own beer.  A great deal of time and effort goes into making a batch of beer, so the brewer is bound to speak highly of their own goods.  It turns out, I\u2019m my own worst critic.  I\u2019m constantly searching for ways to improve the beer.  Whenever I shared brews with others, they always liked it as well, but who doesn\u2019t like free beer?  For me, the seed was planted quite a few years ago when I started winning homebrewing awards statewide.  It was then I began to realize that I was making more than just pretty good homebrew.  I was making some damn good beer!  I began volunteering to judge at homebrew competitions and making an effort to get out and sample more of the beers not available in northern Minnesota.  I quickly realized that there was much more to explore in the world of beer than I realized.  I studied and tasted everything I could find regarding brewing science and beer styles.  In the midst of all of the studying and research, I took the Beer Judge Certification Program test and obtained a National rank in the BJCP.  I now had some credentials to back up my knowledge of good beer and brewing.  It was clear that this was starting to become more than just a hobby, so I began to put a bit more time and effort into the dream of starting a brewery.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this research and planning, what\u2019s the plan?  Start small.\r\n\r\nJack Pine Brewery is starting very small.  Nanobrewery small.  Brewing forty gallons at a time small.  Did I mention the brewer is small?\r\n\r\nThis little brewery serves as a pilot system for the eventual build-out of a full scale production brewery.  It provides the opportunity to test the waters before sinking a boatload of cash into a warehouse full of stainless equipment.  Best of all, it gives YOU a chance to TRY THE BEER!  I\u2019ve been my own worst critic for the past 12 years of homebrewing.  Now it\u2019s your turn.  With your help, we can build a brewery to provide our friends and neighbors with delicious locally-brewed beer.\r\n\r\nSo, stop in and give it a try!",

All the ales have nautical themed names to gel with the surroundings in which it is brewed\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2003 the brewery was bought and renamed the Nelson Brewing Company to fall in line with the most famous naval hero of all time 'Admiral Horatio Nelson' and that his flagship 'The Victory' was built here in Chatham Dockyard.\r\n\r\nIn July 2006 the brewery was purchased by Piers Macdonald. Piers has over 20 years experience in the brewing industry and is passionate to keep the traditions of Kent brewing alive. Using the best ingredients and the finest Kent hops, combined with the expertise and dedication of his brewing staff, Piers plans to build on the brewery's already growing reputation as the provider of some of the tastiest ales on the market.\r\n\r\nNow brewing from a seven and a half barrel kit and regularly having over a dozen ales of various strengths and taste available, the brewery is sure to have a beer to suit all!",

A blend of Willamette and Cascade hops add just enough floral hopiness to keep this from being overly-sweet. The result is a slightly nutty/biscuity, malty beer that is refreshing and low enough in ABV to be able to enjoy a few. Cheers to the English and their session beers!",

They met in September 2002 in the tiny Scottish village of St. Andrews, Scotland. Bailey was a Harvard student doing a semester abroad and Robyn was beginning undergrad at St. Andrews. They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.",

Sixpoint began business by only distributing kegs to local bars and restaurants; instead of bottling its beer, filling growlers at bars were the only way for customers to drink the beer at their homes. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Sixpoint launched initial canned  offerings of 16 oz, year-round styles Sweet Action, Bengali Tiger, Righteous Ale and The Crisp.
