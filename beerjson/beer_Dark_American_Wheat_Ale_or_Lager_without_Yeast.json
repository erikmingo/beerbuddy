                    "description": "Founded in 2010, Piney River Brewing Company is a microbrewery dedicated to making distinctive craft beers that celebrate life in the Ozarks. Joleen and Brian Durham, owners, have lived and farmed in Texas County for many years, and they have enjoyed craft beer for a long time, too.\r\n\r\nToday, Joleen and Brian live up the hill from the Little Piney River that flows into the Big Piney.  They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!",

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the Ebel brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including a line of oak aged ales. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. Two Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.\r\n\r\nA whole family of great beer",

We consider brewing to be a craft and, whether you are brewing in your garage or on a huge production system, brewing a good beer and sharing it with others is a great way to bring together friends or even an entire community. We are proud to live in a town that is currently supporting two brewpubs and a nanobrewery, and look forward to doing our part to be a leader in the craft brewing revolution.\r\n\r\nPeople in the U.P. work hard, take great pride in what is produced locally and have answered the call in supporting and improving the local economy. The name \"Ore Dock Brewing Company\" was chosen because we see our local ore docks as grand and iconic reminders of Marquette and the U.P.'s past, present, and future identity. We hope to provide a product and establishment that our community can be proud of for many years to come!",
