                    "description": "Like most things, there are various ways to make mead. At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!",

It\u2019s native to eastern North America and grows right up the street from us at Jorgensen\u2019s Organic farm in Westerville. The firecracker-red flowers are added to our central Ohio wildflower honey with tons of blueberries from Mansfield, Ohio. The result is a balance of berry and tea flavors with a barely sweet finish. If you can stop drinking it long enough to eat\u2026 try light, creamy cheeses or along side a fresh lemon sorbet.",

The Paw Paw fruit and the spicebush berry are both lesser-used native edibles from the Eastern region of the US. We found our fruit and spice at Integration Acres farm near Albany, Ohio. They host the annual Paw Paw festival and helped make the Paw Paw the native state fruit of Ohio. With all this celebration, we think you\u2019ll understand why each drop of this mead is a statement of the richness and diversity that Ohio is capable of. It bursts a spectrum of tastes - earth, citrus, melon, honey, and spice. Paw Paw blushes a light pink with a semi-sweet finish. Intriguing on it\u2019s own \u2013 and an entirely new experience with food. Explore.",
