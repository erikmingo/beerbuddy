Camusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.\r\n\r\nLocated in Chico, California, Sierra Nevada Brewing is one of the most popular craft breweries currently operating in the United States. Its Pale Ale is world renowned, and the brewery produces almost 700,000 barrels of beer per year. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.",

Originally, the beer was mostly drank in Amsterdam. From 1883, it was also exported to Great Britain and Indonesia.",

Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze.

In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!\r\n\r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly.\r\n\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

After first launching our lightly toasted, complex, full-flavored Toasted Lager, we rapidly gained the respect of beer lovers far and wide. Soon after, we introduced several other brews and were being compared to breweries from noted craft-brewing capitals like Denver, Boston, Portland, and Seattle.\r\n\r\nBrewing isn\u2019t just our business, it\u2019s our passion. We\u2019re beer people. We started Blue Point Brewing Company because we wanted to make beer we would drink. To quench that desire, we select only top-quality ingredients and brew all-natural, unpasteurized beer. It\u2019s this approach that put us on the world beer map. From the World Beer Cup to the Great American Beer Festival and the Australian International Beer Awards \u2013 we\u2019re becoming noticed the world over. But we believe you should be the judge. Let us know what you think.",

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems. New World is now Premier Stainless and Rob and Alan are two of the best in the business.\r\n\r\nWe have three 20 bbl fermenters and one 20 bbl bright tank.",

It continued production until prohibition in 1920. Its award winning ales were well known in the Northeast and were even exported to England and France. Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.\r\n\r\nThe brewery bottled its own beer in Hudson at one of the country\u2019s earliest bottling facilities (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H. Evans Brewing Company memorabilia is displayed in the new facility, as well as pictures of the pump station as it appeared at the turn of the century.",

Its amber color, spicy hop-forward aroma, malty body, and creamy finish truly set this beer apart from all others.\r\n\r\nThe late beer critic Michael Jackson called this recipe, \u201cThe best pilsener I\u2019ve ever tasted in America.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe humbly agree.\r\n\r\nPlease share with your friends, and introduce them to the Baderbr\u00e4u tradition.",

Founded as the first and still only \"Jewish-celebration beer,\"  proprietor, Jeremy Cowan, moved production to New York in 2003 and now distributes in over thirty-one U.S. states and Canada.  Shmaltz is known for blurring beer styles and using puns, art, history, and pop culture in every aspect of its products. Starting out as a contract brewer, third-party brewers produce their lineup using Shmaltz Brewing Company's proprietary recipes. In 2013, Shmaltz was \u201creborn\u201d in Clifton Park, NY, opening its own 50-barrel brewhouse in a 20,000 square foot warehouse just north of the Capitol district. Taking over 100% of their production meant bringing in the Brewmaster, Paul McErlean who designed every one of their award winning recipes, as well as Bob Craven, General Manager, and two of the experienced contract brewers. Shmaltz Brewing now has a true \"home\" for its family of fermented offerings and a tasting room for fans and curious beer lovers to come join the tribe. L'Chaim!",

All of us at Old Yale Brewing  believe that it\u2019s the connections between  people and communities that bring us together much like the road itself. \r\n\r\nWhether it\u2019s our Classic Old Yale Pale Ale, Seargeant\u2019s IPA or nationally acclaimed Sasquatch Stout, we invite you to taste one of BC\u2019s finest craft-brewed beers.",

Soon after, we introduced several other brews and were being compared to breweries from noted craft-brewing capitals like Denver, Boston, Portland, and Seattle.\r\n\r\nBrewing isn\u2019t just our business, it\u2019s our passion. We\u2019re beer people. We started Blue Point Brewing Company because we wanted to make beer we would drink. To quench that desire, we select only top-quality ingredients and brew all-natural, unpasteurized beer. It\u2019s this approach that put us on the world beer map. From the World Beer Cup to the Great American Beer Festival and the Australian International Beer Awards \u2013 we\u2019re becoming noticed the world over. But we believe you should be the judge.

Once settling on the name,the architecture and the image flowed naturally. Stone and wood are combined with the high vaulted ceiling to create the feel of those great lodges in our Northwest National parks.We have urbanized it a bit with the steel structure and industrial designed light fixtures. The Brewery Tower is a prominent feature along with the NXNW grain silos. The one directly in front of the Brewery Tower is a functioning silo full of 25,000 lbs. of barley \u2013 the major component ofthe beer making process. All the beers at NXNW are brewed right on site inside the Tower.",

Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are medium to high, and use of noble-type hops for flavor and aroma is preferred. Up to 25 percent corn and/or rice in the grist should be used. Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze. Competition organizers may wish to subcategorize this style into rice and corn subcategories.",

Without their valiant efforts, our world would slip into darkness.\r\n\r\nThe Beer: We seek to brew the very best craft beer out of Portland. With our unique touches on classic styles and our constant efforts to innovate and lead craft brewing into new, uncharted territories, even the most discerning palates will find something they love. Two year-round offerings, four seasonals and a series of four big-bottle beers will make sure of that.\r\n\r\nThe City: Considered to be the epicenter of the American craft brewing resurgence, Portland, Oregon is home to more breweries than any other city in America. Portland Brewing was one of the first craft brewers in the city and created Portland\u2019s original Amber Ale. A favorite throughout the years, when Portlander\u2019s say \u201cGimme a Mac\u2019s\u201d it\u2019s understood they want the crisp, distinct flavor that MacTarnahan\u2019s Amber Ale is known for.",

You may better remember the building as the former home of the Shanghai Restaurant and bar, where scenes from the movie, Phenomenon were filmed.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance of the Auburn Alehouse combines the charm and character of this historic brick and mortar building with the bold industrial elements of a gleaming 10-barrel microbrewery.\r\n\r\nGuests and friends can enjoy lunch, dinner, and libation while watching the freshly crafted beer they are drinking being produced just a few feet away.\r\n\r\nThere is also an outdoor patio with a great view of the historic Auburn courthouse. There are always at least 6-8 beers on tap and Hard Cider and select \"guest\" craft beers are also available on draught. Interestingly, the Auburn Alehouse is located just 1/10th of a mile from the original Auburn Brewery, which brewed for thirsty Auburnites from 1855 until 1908. You may stop by for the ale, but you\u2019ll find the food is a star attraction as well. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for pub fare or a sit down dinner, there is something for every one at the Alehouse.",

We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.",

It is with great pride that we are making this classic European style lager available as our newest seasonal beer starting this summer from July till September. \r\n\r\nBrewed with North American lager malt and Czechoslovakian hops and yeast, Gold Mountain Pilsner beautifully blends old world and new. A lagering period (cold storage) of 4 to 6 weeks allows this most delicate of brews to become bright and clear. At this time, the malt character is now fully developed and the entire beer has lost its rough edges becoming soft and elegant. The perfect pint for a warm summers day or any day for that matter, Gold Mt. Pilsner rewards with clean, crisp, quaffable flavor every time.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).",

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors and was sold to other Cincinnati interests when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Company, the last remaining Cincinnati brewery. The lager of this era was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of further sales that took the business out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati, OH by its current local ownership. A brewery/gastropub has been opened on the Cincinnati riverfront and a major production facility is expanding in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district.  The company also owns the Hudepohl, Burger and Schoenling brands.",

Here is a little rundown about what Fifty West is all about:\r\n\r\nAll the beers brewed at Fifty West Brewing Company have been hand made in small batches with a focus on craftsmanship, tradition, innovation, and patience.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why we selected the name \u2018Fifty West\u2019; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California. \r\n\r\nThe brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http://www.cincinnati.com/dining/heritage/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today\u2014amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement.\r\n\r\nTo us, it\u2019s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.",

Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze.

They are light colored lager beers whose flowery hop aroma is followed by a rich malty sweetness and ends with a firm bitterness. Mass produced American beers say they are of this style but have extremely lightened malt and hop characteristics. Our Indian Paintbrush Pilsner is a traditional style European pilsner, brewed with 100% pilsner malt. Hopping with Czech lineage hops produces a spicy bitterness as well as a crisp finish. The alcohol content is 5.0% by volume. Indian Paintbrush Pilsner is a signature beer of Cory Buenning.\r\n\r\nNorth American Brewers Fest 2010 \u2013  Gold",

We attribute this success to beer drinkers gravitating to beers with more interesting flavor profiles. The unique flavor complexity of Avery beers occurs through a combination of sparing no expense with regard to ingredients and our hopping methods. Sparing no expense means using lots of specialty malts, imported hops, such as Styrian Goldings, and imported Belgian candy sugar.",

Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.",

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!",

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.",

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.",

Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American).

We currently offer two delicious styles of beer on draft in select Atlanta establishments.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the idea for Monday Night Brewing grew out of a small Atlanta Bible study. We started brewing beer together on Monday nights as a way to get to know each other better. As we got more engrained in the industry and more people started showing up to brew with us, beer quickly became more than just a weeknight hobby.\r\n\r\nWe spent almost 5 years perfecting our Eye Patch Ale and Drafty Kilt Scotch Ale before bringing them to market. Years of minor tweaks, arguments over hop profiles, and experiments with different brands of base malts are poured into every glass that we brew.",

After a long and tumultuous journey involving disaster and triumph;  joy and heartache ~  they began to build. Following fourteen months of design, building and construction they finally fired up the brew kettle for the first time in December of 1999. Although the brewery was tiny and tucked in a basement on Pearl Street, the celebration and Grand Opening was enough to attract throngs of flavor starved people and get Mayor Medinger to tap the inaugural keg.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way since. Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery. The new brewery has over six times the brewing capacity of the old Pearl Street Brewhouse. And while we spent the first 8 years slinging brews out to nearby pubs and restaurants in draught kegs only, in July of 2007, we unveiled bottled beer in six packs and cases.",

Our hand-crafted beer is made in small batches to ensure quality and peak freshness, while the healthy and delicious menu has ingredients sourced from local farms and markets wherever possible. Take the time to notice our bar, furniture, and fixtures which were all handcrafted by local wood and metal worker Keith Kocher (Lightstreet Custom Woodworking). Check out our unique tap handles carved and forged by local artist/sculptor J. Mark Irwin (Irwin Sculpture Studio), and our plates, bowls, and beer mugs, all hand-made by local potter Mike Hart (M.

In the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz\u2019s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.",

Stephen was in Europe doing research in molecular biology and experienced its beer culture that lead to his mid-career crisis.  He started writing about beer, and then tried to open a brewery in Arlon, Belgium but that faltered.  He then formed the first beer-of-the-month club in Europe, Beer Around the World.  Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU.  One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere.  Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world. He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland.   One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme.  It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven.  The new company was registered in Baltimore and the new beer was eventually produced in Nagold, Germany and called in honor of Baltimore's Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Special Lager.",

Penn\u2019s flagship lineup features authentic German-style beers brewed in the tradition of Pittsburgh\u2019s German immigrants, according to the strict quality standards of Reinheitsgebot.  \r\nMore recently, our lineup has been expanded to include other varieties including APAs, IPAs, fruit beers, and more.  The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

The goal of Spalt Select was to reproduce the classic noble hop character of the Spalt Spalter landrace in a more easily grown hop. Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since \"Spalt\" or \"Spalter\" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as \"Spalter Select.\" In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau. Some growers are currently growing Spalt Select as an organic hop.",

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.",

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.",

While your \"good\" nature will definitely be aroused by this cool, spirit-raising refreshment, your inner evil will soon begin to feel less inhibited, allowing initial laughter and fun to soon require an internal battle of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nHistory - Since the dawn of mankind, we have struggled with the battle of good and evil. To drown in guilt or sorrow is unhealthy and seen by some as wasted emotions. In opposition, to live our lives completely without impure influence and to be seen by all as \u201cup-tight\u201d without the ability to cut loose on occasion is viewed in equally a negative fashion. Until now, there has never been a respectable or enjoyable solution to this life long struggle.\r\nHolyBrew is a positive channel for cleansing one\u2019s mind, body and spirit of unwanted or unnecessary guilt, doubt or unhappiness. Through a recently discovered magical formula, believed to be created from the gods themselves, HolyBrew has formulated the \u201cLiquid Confession\u201d. What better way to cleanse one\u2019s soul than to partake of this succulent brew, confess one\u2019s sins and erroneous ways and let the weight of their guilt be lifted and their thirst quenched simultaneously.\r\nJoin the movement in guilt-free pleasure and refreshment. Have your liquid confession today and enjoy life to its fullest.",

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became \u0003a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the \u0003facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great \u0003city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.",

Early missteps led to a cult following and eventually led to widespread acclaim that inspired countless craft brewers. Still, more than 25 years later, no brewery has been able to achieve the pure, unqualified Liquid Goodness of Redhook.",

It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.",

Route 52 is not a weak, timid American lager.\r\n\r\nRoute 52 derives its name from the National Scenic Byway that passes by Twin Lakes Farm. The community is rich in history, art and beauty. Our location and historic setting inspire us to craft a beer that reflects our heritage.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

Every autumn for over twenty years, Jim Koch has traveled to one of the oldest hop growing regions in the world, the Hallertau region of Bavaria Germany, to hand select the Noble hops for our beers, including the Hallertau Mittelfrueh variety.  This special variety is considered to be one of the best in the world.  Samuel Adams\u00ae Hallertau Imperial Pilsner is a celebration of these extraordinary hops. \r\n\r\nThis beer is one of the hoppiest in the world.  With the first sip there\u2019s an explosion of some of the world's finest hops.  And we mean \u201cexplosion\u201d in a good way.  This bold brew highlights the spicy, citrus flavors and aromas of the Hallertau Mittelfrueh hop that is abundant in the recipe.  The Hallertau Mittelfrueh hop is prized for its delicate flavor rather than purely for its level of bitterness.  As a result, the high levels of these hops give the beer an intense flavor without being overpowering. The beer remains well balanced from beginning to end, and continues to always be, well, \"hoppy,\" providing hop lovers with an amazing beer drinking experience.",

Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered.

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

In fact, when it comes to beer tradition, his grandfather George A. Sleeman wrote the book on it - literally. \r\n\r\nJohn's family's brewing tradition in Canada extends back to 1834 when John H. Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. \r\n\r\nThe passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nPremium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.",

Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze.

He was convicted, not once but twice, for breaking the federal Prohibition Act.\r\n\r\nProhibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla.\r\n\r\nThose customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1995, through tireless efforts on the part of Joe Prichard, the grandson of the founder, Pete's Place reintroduced Choc beer as part of the restaurant's tradition and a \"legal\" brew for customers.",

Every beer is hand-crafted in small batches using traditional brewing methods. We package our beer in self-pressurizing mini-kegs that hold the equivalent of a case of beer, half\u2013gallon refillable growler bottles and 1/6 barrel (5 gallon) kegs that can be used in commercial and home draft systems. Some of our specialty beers, like our Cherry Ale, will only be available in limited quantities.\r\nWe are a production brewery that sells beer right from the premises. Although we don\u2019t currently have a tasting room where we can sell beer by the glass \u2013 we will be offering samples to help you decide which beer to purchase.\r\n\r\nWe are open to the public Wednesday-Friday 2pm to 7pm, Saturday 12 (noon) to 7pm and Sunday 12 (noon) to 4pm. You can purchase our beers outside of the brewery at The Pour House in Aurora, Indiana, Bakers Discount Liquors in Rising Sun, Indiana and Whitey\u2019s in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. We are also available on draft at Bourbons Bar & Grill in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.",

            "description": "Texas Pils is unlike any Pilsner you've ever tasted.  While this lager is based on traditional recipes, several modifications make this beer exceptional.  The grist is over 90% Hanka variety Pilsner malt from Bohemia: an heirloom barley variety related to the oldest cultivated barleys in Eastern Europe.  This barley has a rich, smooth taste that stands up to the noticeable hop character of this beer. To live up to its big name, we've made it slightly higher in ABV too (6%).  To match the increase in gravity, we've also added more hops, and not the usual suspects.  A new hop variety from Germany named Polaris lends a unique character to the beer reminiscent of spicy mint and alpine herbs. Traditionally brewed Pilsners have a medium body, and ours stays true to this, providing ample body to support the increased hop character and bitterness.  Perfect for relaxing on the patio or even for cooler Fall weather, this versatile lager broadens the horizon for traditionally brewed Pilsner lager.",

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

The building was previously owned by a local printing company and had been gutted by a massive fire and the project took three painstaking years to complete. However, the endeavor was well worth it as Brown\u2019s Brewing Company became an instant success as the first brewery restaurant in the Capital Region.\r\n\r\nToday, our River Street Taproom in Troy, New York is a social hub for the community and offers a menu that compliments the beer we brew on site. We brew over 25 different styles of ales and lagers throughout the year and serve over a dozen beers on tap at any one time. Our dependable ales and lagers are also available in bottles at home or on draft in select taverns and restaurants throughout the Capital Region.",

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",

Hop bitterness, flavor and aroma are medium to high, and use of noble-type hops for flavor and aroma is preferred. Up to 25 percent corn and/or rice in the grist should be used. Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze. Competition organizers may wish to subcategorize this style into rice and corn subcategories.",
