                    "description": "Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",

Lightly toasted and caramel malts highlight the aroma with noticeable undertones of birch, figs and spun sugar. The flavor is also lightly malty with a delicate earthy or floral sweetness at the front that develops into a soft but not cloying mouthfeel. The birch syrup adds a subtle woodsy and sherry-like character that mingles with the hop bitterness to create clean and dry finish that nicely masks the spice of alcohol in this medium-bodied beer.",

Fresh apple pie with a slice of smoked Gouda, cinnamon chocolate torte or a fruity spice cake are excellent dessert choices, while appetizers of sweet potato fries or a soft white cheese fondue would match up well to this richly malty brew.",

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

Unlike other high-gravity brews, Andygator is fermented to a dry finish with a slightly sweet flavor and subtle fruit aroma. Reaching an alcohol strength of 8% by volume, it is a Helles Dopplebock.\r\n\r\nYou might find it goes well with fried foods. It pairs well with just about anything made with crawfish. Some like it with a robust sandwich! Andygator also is a good aperitif and easily pairs with gorgonzola and creamy blue cheeses. Because of the high alcohol content, be cautious---sip it for the most enjoyment.",

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!",

In fact, ALE ASYLUM operates the only bottling facility in Madison.\r\n\r\nALE ASYLUM is unfiltered and all natural. We use no additives, preservatives, fruit, horse hooves, fish guts, or extracts. Our ingredient list: water, malt, hops, and yeast. This is what we mean when we say our beer is FERMENTED IN SANITY. You know who makes it, you know what it\u2019s made with. You know after having one you\u2019ll want another.\r\n\r\nWe brew traditional, bold beers for those who demand quality and consistency.

Today, as in the early years is adorned with a picture of Charlemagne, the label of binding double trestle. It has drawn the painter Fritz Boehle. The friend of the family brewers binding, by their generous support, had the Carolingian 1914 drawing up his horse and thus given the \"Carolus\" an unmistakable appearance. And so the reminiscent of Carolus Sachsenhausen hill with each bottle and the more than twelve-hundred-year history of Frankfurt.\r\n\r\nWith an original gravity of 18.5 percent and 7.5 percent alcohol by volume, he heats his friends so true. Connoisseurs appreciate his dark sparkle and love the full-bodied, malt-aromatic flavor. Who cares there already, that he ml on at least 70 calories per 100 does, and thus not really a \"slimming\" in the Binding beers range counts.\r\n\r\nCarolus's from October till after Christmas in the 0.5-or 0.33-liter bottle and fresh from the tap",

In addition to brewing according to the Law of Purity, we decided not to filter or pasteurize our Bavarian Lagers to ensure the vitamins remain whole for that rich, mellow taste. Within months of opening the pub we began selling Red Oak to other accounts in the Greensboro area. In no time the 6 original aging tanks were maxed out so we added on to the building and installed 13 new tanks. By 2001 Red Oaks popularity had grown so much that we were brewing 24/7...and out of aging capacity. We began the search for a location to build a larger brewery with space to accommodate future growth.  After settling on a 12 acre tract along I 40/85 between Greensboro and Burlington in 2003...we began discussions with 3 Bavarian Brewery fabricators. Rolec of Cheming, Bavaria was chosen to supply the new brewery; and in 2005 construction began on the building to house it.  By the summer of 2007 Red Oak was ready to open the nation's most modern computerized brewing facility...consistently producing the Freshest, Purest, Bavarian Lagers in America.",

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

Although Ayinger Brewery was founded in a picturesque village 25 kilometers from Munich in 1878, the site of the Ayinger Gasthaus Brewery Hotel has been one of Bavaria's most famous restaurants for more than 500 years.\r\n\r\nIn the shadow of the Alps, nestled in the 1200 year-old village of Aying (pronounced eye-ing), Brauerei Aying produces 12 different styles of beers, more than most of the larger breweries. The Ayinger Brewery has been owned and operated by the same family since 1878 and represents one of the most pleasant and interesting small breweries which are typical of Europe. Brewing good beer is the premier duty of Aying, and people come from all over the world to sample the wares.\r\n\r\nIn a land of wonderful breweries, Ayinger is considered a benchmark of excellence. In recent years, Ayinger regularly places first in every category entered in the World Beer Championships; the brewery has gold medals from the Helsinki Beer Fest, the Stockholm Beer & Whiskey Festival, the Calagary Brewfest, and the Deutsche Landwirtschaftsgesellschaft (German Agricultural Society).",

Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt character is an expression of toasted barley malt. Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

Our role as an integral member of the artisan approach is something we take seriously, yet engage lightheartedly.\r\n\r\nWe believe the art of craft lives in fostering rich experiences for our customers, through creating authentic beer, spirits and food while providing great service. Recognized for our creativity and artistry, our mission to improve the lives of craft consumers everywhere is seen in our diverse, balanced collection of beer and spirits.\r\n\r\nNew Holland brews and distills at two locations in Holland, Michigan: our production facility on the north side and our Pub & Restaurant in downtown Holland. The restaurant welcomes guests seven days a week and production tours are on Saturday afternoons. We welcome visitors and locals alike, and appreciate the opportunity to share our artisan approach through warm hospitality and enriching education.\r\n\r\nWith just under 150 employees, New Holland Brewing Co. sells its beer and spirits across a growing regional landscape, while anchored in the upper Midwest. In 2012, our production facility underwent substantial development including the tripling of our brewing capacity through outdoor fermentation, the addition of a centrifuge and the expansion of our Dragon\u2019s Milk cellar. In 2013, the company is expanding its distilling capabilities, renovating the downtown Holland Pub & Restaurant and focusing on the integration of Michigan agriculture; hops, wheat and barley, into several new and existing brands.",

Our publicly-held brewery employs over 150 people who are as passionate about quality craft beer as Kurt & Rob themselves.\r\n\r\nWe opened the brewery in 1984, and built a new 40-barrel brewing system in our current Russell Street location in 1990. We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish. And for those of you with a sweet tooth we make a fantastic Root Beer!",

The dedication to brewing flavorful, unfiltered, quality craft beers that started in 1985 is still with us today. We currently brew over 20 beers for distribution as well as many other small batch beers that are served at our pub in Kalamazoo, the Eccentric Cafe.

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

It seems only fitting that beer is being brewed in this quaint little two-story brick structure built in the 1920's. It's had its history as the jail, fire station, courthouse, mason lodge, and last but not least a sandwich shop that made those little sandwiches you can buy in gas stations. You know the triangle packaged ones that have mystery meat in them? Don't lie, you've had one. Today it is home to JailHouse Brewing Company and we are brewing hand-crafted beer not punching out license plates.",

In 1984 it was overhauled and sold to Brauerei H\u00fcmmer of Breiteng\u00fc\u00dfbach, Germany, a village in the Franconian region of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nBrauerei H\u00fcmmer started brewing beer in the Franconian village of Breiteng\u00fc\u00dfbach in 1642. The brewery served the town for over 350 years until the spring of 2011. It made several styles including Altfr\u00e4nkisches Dunkel Bier, a rare specialty beer that we will revive in Denver.",

The brewery is now in Longmont, CO - a much larger town just east of Lyons. Oskar Blues is unique in that it serves craft-brewed beer in cans, contrary to the normal practice of bottling micro brews. The brewery is owned by Dale Katechis, a native of Florence, Alabama who brought canned beer and southern fried foods together for an interesting twist on the micro-brew pub.",

Malt character is more reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich- style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt character. Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt character is an expression of toasted barley malt. Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

            "description": "Double Vision Doppelbock was brewed to highlight our brewery's wonderful water. Like all the great traditional brewing towns, our home, Victor, Idaho, is in or near some of the world's best barley- and hop-growing regions, and is distinguished by an ample supply of top-quality water.\r\n\r\nThe 17th century Paulist monks of Munich were allowed no solid food during their twice-yearly fasts. They brewed an especially nourishing strong dark lager they called \u201cliquid bread\u201d and named \u201cHoly Father\u201d to help them through the Lenten and Advent fasts. The beer was known as a doppelbock, which signifies a strong lager. Since \u201cbock\u201d also means \u201cbilly goat\u201d in German, these beers are often decorated with images of gallivanting goats. Our Double Vision label features two goats in front of a waterfall\u2014a reminder of the importance of water to the development of the style as well as the taste of this strong lager.\r\n\r\nOur Double Vision Doppelbock is brewed with Idaho 2-Row Pale and German Munich, CaraAroma, CaraMunich and de-husked Carafa malts to an original gravity of 24 Plato (1.096 SG). The malts provide a dark leather color with ruby notes, a luxurious tan head, and a bready aroma with a hint of smoke. It is lightly spiced with Liberty hops, an American version of the noble German Hallertau Mittelfruh, and fermented with lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich. In the traditional manner, Double Vision is fermented cold (48 F) and lagered a full 10 weeks for smoothness. At over 8% alcohol by volume, it is a deceptively drinkable springtime warmer.\r\n\r\nDouble Vision\u2019s slightly burnt caramel flavor and malt sweetness make it an incredible match for game\u2014venison, moose, duck, goose, wild boar\u2014especially when prepared with fruity sauces or reductions. Try it with pork and saut\u00e9ed apples, roasted root vegetables, sweet sausages, ham or prosciutto. It\u2019s wonderful with cheese and dessert, too. Pair it with an aged gruyere, a caramel flan, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e or tart tatin.",

Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

Malt character is more reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich- style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt character. Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt character is an expression of toasted barley malt. Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

One hundred and eighty five years have passed since then, with Pivovarna La\u0161ko growing from a local brewery to the leading producer of beer and together with other companies in the Group, into the leading producer of mineral and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages and other beverages on the Slovene market.\r\n\r\nBeverages production belongs to the more competitive industries, where multinational corporations, commercial companies and demanding users play the most important roles.\r\n\r\nPivovarna La\u0161ko and the La\u0161ko Group are embarking on a path of development with the following basic business orientation: to produce and sell innovative trendy products, maintain the market position of its own brand names on the domestic market and to attain again and expand positions in foreign markets achieved in the past.\u00a0 Furthermore, to use the most advanced technology in the development of appropriate production and commercial programs which guarantee the top quality of beer, non-alcoholic beverages and mineral and natural water.\r\n\r\nThe umbrella brand La\u0161ko is represented by the following products: the La\u0161ko Zlatorog, the special beers La\u0161ko Club, La\u0161ko Dark, and La\u0161ko Light,\u00a0 the light beer Export Pils and the sweet beverage La\u0161ko Malt with apple and peach flavours. In addition to the above brands Pivovarna La\u0161ko also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions Pivovarna La\u0161ko brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna La\u0161ko entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna La\u0161ko, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe Pivovarna La\u0161ko Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.",

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors and was sold to other Cincinnati interests when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Company, the last remaining Cincinnati brewery. The lager of this era was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of further sales that took the business out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati, OH by its current local ownership. A brewery/gastropub has been opened on the Cincinnati riverfront and a major production facility is expanding in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district.  The company also owns the Hudepohl, Burger and Schoenling brands.",

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

Malt character is more reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich- style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt character. Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt character is an expression of toasted barley malt. Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

                    "description": "The name of the Paulaner brewery refers to the order of friars that resided in Neuhauser Stra\u00dfe in Munich who were part of the order of Saint Francis of Paola. The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).",

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

We brew high quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron, Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

It was originally brewed by monks to provide a nutritious drink during the Lenten Fast when no solid food was allowed. This has earned doppelbock the nickname \"liquid bread\" because of its rich and filling quality.\r\n\r\nThomas Hooker Doppelbock Lager blends huge amounts of imported Munich, Vienna and Moravian malts with select dark roasted malts to achieve a malt lover's dream of a rich and creamy brew. Subtly hopped with noble German and Czech hops and cool fermented with a Bavarian lager yeast, this beer will leave you happy to give up solid food for a while. \r\n\r\nNo dessert necessary.",

After nearly 500 years of tradition, the secularization in 1803 and the following privatisation led to a privately owned company: Augustiner Br\u00e4u. In 1817 it moved to the Neuhauser Stra\u00dfe, the very same place where the renowned \"Stammhaus\" still stands today. In 1829 the Wagner family took over the company and eventually moved it to the \"Kellerareal\" at the Landsberger Stra\u00dfe in 1885.",

We use only the finest, most appropriate malts, hops, water and yeast in our beers.  While our lagers are similar to those made in Germany, they are our own unique interpretation of the style. \r\n\r\nLager beers are fermented at lower temperatures than ale, using yeast that has adapted to cooler fermentations.  Low temperature fermentations create fewer \u201cyeasty\u201d aromas, esters, and flavors that are so common in ales.  We brew lagers because we enjoy their smooth malty and hoppy character.",

We call our beer Mediator because we think that a 22 ounce bottle is probably better shared than drunk alone.

                    "description": "Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",

Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.",

Olvi allows its beers to mature slowly and gradually, which is the only way as there is no shortcut to success.\r\n\r\nAll Olvi's beers are lager beers, which means that they are produced with bottom-fermenting yeast. Lager beers are either dark or light. The bottom-fermenting yeast ferments the beers in a cool temperature, which produces a very fresh, crisp taste and aroma. All Olvi beers are unpasteurized.",

In 2007 its market share in Alko was 38 % in the strong\r\nIV B -beers segment. Its strong alcoholic flavour is softened by a freshness of taste that is brought about by extended fermentation. A strong and aromatic hop-infused flavour completes the smooth taste. OLVI Tuplapukki is coppery in colour with an enduring foam. The drink makes an excellent beverage to be slowly savoured or simply enjoyed as a night cap. To fully appreciate OLVI Tuplapukki, it needs to be enjoyed well cooled,\r\nat a temperature of about 10 - 12 degrees Celsius.",

The monks had brewed beer for their own use since 1634. The beer that was permitted to be sold on holidays was a Bock style which gained local fame. After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V. (49.9%).",

Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to\u2026A madman\u2019s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.\r\n \r\nTrue patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t. No matter, as you\u2019re drinking some of the best fuckin\u2019 beer made in the great state of Michigan. Period!",

Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.",

The eucalyptus wood lends notes of chocolate, balanced with a hint of toffee and smoky dryness from the yellow poplar. Months of taste-testing determined Plank II's beer style and the types of wood used in the brewing process. The final product is the brainchild of Heavy Seas brewers, firkinmeister Steve Marsh, wood expert John Gasparine, and MD Homebrewers' Guild President Les White.\r\n\r\nPlank II is the second edition in our Plank series, which was established to feature a unique wood aging treatment pioneered by Heavy Seas and wood expert John Gasparine. In this process, we \u201cdeconstruct the barrel,\u201d putting the wood in the beer; this process adds flavor differently than barrel-aging or adding toasted wood does. The wood we mature the beer on has been retified. This revolutionary thermal process was adapted from the construction industry by wood expert John Gasparine, and it can transform mundane species of wood into flavor powerhouses. We brew and release Plank beers periodically.",

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits. Perhaps during your visit with us, you\u2019ll encounter the unexpected.",

The founder and driving force of High Point is award-winning homebrewer, Greg Zaccardi. After working as a brewer in southern Germany, Greg returned to the US to open his brewery.\r\n\r\nRamstein beers are made with the same care and precision that Greg learned in Germany. In fact, the wheat, barley, hops and yeast used to make Ramstein Beers are all imported directly from Bavaria.\r\n\r\nGreg found a special brewer\u2019s yeast used only by a small brewery in Bavaria. He was able to get the brewery to let him use the special yeast exclusively at High Point. The unique, complex character of Ramstein beers is a result of this private yeast and of course, High Point\u2019s careful and proper brewing methods.\r\n\r\nThe name Ramstein was adopted from a town in Germany with a large American population. The town surrounds the U.S. Ramstein Air Force Base. High Point wanted the name of its beers to reflect a marriage of German tradition and American innovation.\r\n\r\nToday High Point Brewing Company expanded beyond wheat beers and brews 11 different wheat beers and lagers.",

Deep full flavors of caramel and chocolate malt balance with hops for a smooth warming character. The finish is smooth and malty leading to a subtle alcohol and dark caramel finish. The wonderful balance of this beer provides a complex profile that hides the 9.5% alcohol content. The perfect companion for a cold winter night.",

They called their full-bodied brew \u201cSalvator.\u201d Today it is customary to pay homage to the good brothers by giving doppelbocks names ending in \u201c-ator.\u201d Our version bids a fond aufwiedersehen to tradition, charting a flight path into bold new territory. Medium amber in color, it offers a heady, estery banana aroma. Rich maltiness predominates, with cedar aging lending just a hint of spice to the finish.",

Throughout the area, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2ll find armies of fisherman, clad in blaze orange parkas and snowmobile suits, dragging their crudely built ice shanties onto the frozen lakes. While they vary in size, shape and color, each shanty contains an enthusiast braving the cold; spinning their tall tales; staring deeply into that hole in the ice; and, of course, enjoying a Legendary Wisconsin Beer. Brewed in the fall to help you survive our Wisconsin winters.\n\nShantytown Doppelbock is brewed in the style of a German Doppelbock. Brown in color with malty sweetness and a full body.",

Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada.

Commemorator is a bold style that would have been very familiar to Kosmos. One of the highlights of the Bavarian brewing year is the rollout of strong beer or starkbier, developed by monks as \u201cliquid bread\u201d to sustain them through the Lenten season. Commemorator is brewed in that Old-World tradition and embodies the German-Czech heritage Shiner has proudly stood for since 1909. This 17 % original extract dark lager is a blend of two row Munich and Caramel 60 malt mildly spiced with Bavarian Hallertau Tradition and Spalter Select hops to allow the toasted caramel flavor to predominate.",

When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that \"Hallertau Hallertauer\" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name \"Hallertau\" or \"Hallertauer\", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fcher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as \"noble\" and characteristic of the great German lagers.",

This brew has a delicate malty palate up front, which is abruptly overshadowed by the dominating ho presence that can be attributed to 1.5lbs/bbl of hops that were added to this brew for aroma & flavor.

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

Some elements of caramel and toffee can be evident and contribute to complexity, but the predominant malt character is an expression of toasted barley malt. Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind. Wisconsin has a great heritage of being a lager beer producing state. We want to carry on this tradition by producing beers with a strong German stylistic emphasis and yet be open to other variations.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

I want to do something that fits in between.\"\r\n\r\nThe dream for Buttera started when he was in college, and a friend turned him on to home brewing, which he has been doing now for about 13 years. Four years ago, his love of home brewing led him to open the Point Brew Supply, 1816 Post Road, Plover, with his wife, Katina.\r\n\r\n\"It (Point Brew Supply) has opened my eyes to all the different ingredients that I think a lot of brewers don't have exposure to,\" \"I've played with every single strain of yeast and grain and hop in there.\r\n\r\nO'so Brewing Co. is planning to have a varied lineup of beers, with interesting names and flavors. They will have a red ale, a West Coast Pale Ale showcasing American hops, as well as a Black Cocker Bock.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to show the world what I've learned, and I'm definitely not going to do things like other people are, but I think I'm on some sort of weird cutting edge.\r\n\r\nThe brewery has a capacity to brew about 280 gallons per batch, with plans to brew twice a week.

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

The brewery is now in Longmont, CO - a much larger town just east of Lyons. Oskar Blues is unique in that it serves craft-brewed beer in cans, contrary to the normal practice of bottling micro brews. The brewery is owned by Dale Katechis, a native of Florence, Alabama who brought canned beer and southern fried foods together for an interesting twist on the micro-brew pub.",

Fortunately for beer lovers in North Texas, Fritz not only fell in love with Fort Worth, but also fell in love with his future wife here. And in another fortuitous twist for all of us, Fritz\u2019s wife, Erin, gave him the thumbs up when he announced that he would like to carry on the Rahr family tradition of brewing.\r\n\r\nFritz and Erin founded Rahr & Sons Brewing Co. in the fall of 2004. In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.",

The Troegenator leaves a rich, warming feeling and subtle spicy flavors. The style, Double Bock, dates back a century or so ago. During periods of fasting without solid foods, the Monastic brewers relied on the double bock; a stronger, richer beer to fulfill their basic nutritional needs. Known to them as \"liquid bread,\" a double bock has a strong malt aroma and chewy rich body. Traditionally these brewers ended the name of their double bock with the suffix \"ator\", ex. Celabrator, Illuminator, Subliminator... In the spirit of the tradition we give you the Troegenator to provide warmth and richness through the early spring months. A double bock of epic proportions, beware,\r\nthe Troegenator is deceiving smooth and delicious.the Troegenator is deceiving smooth and delicious.\"\"",

                    "description": "Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",

Brewed to highlight flavors and aromas from specialty malts and toasted French oak, Alaskan\u2019s Troppelbock is a much bigger, complex, and slightly sweeter take on the classic Doppelbock style.\r\n\r\nAlaskan Troppelbock is a tawny, copper-colored ale with thick, ivory lacing. Toasty, biscuit, and caramel malt notes dominate the aroma but do not overwhelm the delicate undertones of freshly hewn oak and pecan pie-like nuttiness. The flavor is similarly complex; a huge, toasted malt profile melds with subtle fig, dark fruit, milk chocolate, and vanilla notes. The mouthfeel is warming, soft, and full, with moderately low carbonation and a slightly dry finish.", 
            "foodPairings": "Alaskan Troppelbock\u2019s complex flavor profile provides opportunity for both complementary and contrasting pairings of all kinds. Start with an Irish sharp cheddar grilled cheese sandwich, raspberry pork tenderloin, or honey-glazed ham, add a robust spinach salad with nuts, fruit, and a crumbly, salty cheese like gorgonzola, and finish it off with a chili-chocolate bar or tiramisu.",

Doppelbocks are full bodied and deep amber to dark brown in color. Astringency from roast malts is absent. Alcoholic strength is high, and hop rates increase with gravity. Hop bitterness and flavor should be low and hop aroma absent. Fruity esters are commonly perceived but at low to moderate levels. Diacetyl should be absent",
