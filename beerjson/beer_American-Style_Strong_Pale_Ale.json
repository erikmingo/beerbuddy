From landing in the welcoming arms of Petaluma, and actually getting our beer into bottles, onto the streets, and into the hands of sympathatic beer geeks, to steadily losing less money each month. From all this and more, Lagunitas Brewing Company is emerging as a battle-tested brewery capable of making great beer out of goat's milk, brambles, and asphalt on the surface of the Moon, if need be.\r\n\r\nAs the poet once said, 'Where, but for the grace of God and the kindness of strangers, go I'.

Note that floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American strong pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruityester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

He was convicted, not once but twice, for breaking the federal Prohibition Act.\r\n\r\nProhibition was repealed in the late 1950s, but home brewed beverages were still illegal because they didn't bear the proper liquor stamps. Nevertheless, homemade Choc and wine continued to be available to regular customers at Pete's, a restaurant owned by Prichard in Krebs, Okla.\r\n\r\nThose customers happen to include JFK and high-powered Oklahoma politicians.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1995, through tireless efforts on the part of Joe Prichard, the grandson of the founder, Pete's Place reintroduced Choc beer as part of the restaurant's tradition and a \"legal\" brew for customers.",

Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.",

And then prohibition shut it down. Re-established in 2007, we are honored to say that four months and four beers in, Mission was awarded two national medals at the Great American Beer Festival. Fast forward to 2010 our plunder of precious beer medals has gown considerably. Three Gold, three Silver and two Bronze medals now fill our bounty. A dream come true for long-time die-hard home brewers. From modest beginnings to a state of the art custom made brewery in the historic Wonderbread building just east of San Diego\u2019s baseball stadium Petco Park. Our brewery should be brewing beer with in the month. Soon therafter our tasting bar will be open to the public. There\u2019s nothing more enjoyable than a pint while watching the beer you\u2019re drinking being made a few feet from where you\u2019re sitting.\r\nNo catchy gimmicks. No national campaigns. Just great handcrafted beer made in San Diego!",

There is a malty sweetness followed by a developing bready sweet flavor. Hints of complex caramel flavors come across that finish out with the brute bitterness. After taking a sip, the clean finish allows the alcohol to develop, giving you that warming feeling. Mild carbonation helps provide the palate with a low mouthfeel thus more flavor.",

Each beer is named after a local feature that is unique to the area.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery is located on the side of the largest mountain in Orange County in the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. The great views from Santiago peak and the trails through the canyons provide some of the natural inspiration for the beers and the company.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small and accessible to all with a warm and comfortable tasting area.

In 2008, Doug landed at Thornbridge Brewery and in the company of kindred brewing spirits. This visit led to a collaboration brew at Thornbridge in 2010. Fast forward to 2012 to find the two breweries at it again, this time at Odell Brewing. Pond Hopper Double Extra Pale Ale is the love child of this international brewmance. Brewed with English malts and American hops, Pond Hopper brings together the best ingredients each country has to offer, balancing a subtle sweet malt character with hints of mango and peach hop flavor. It pours a rich golden color with citrus and ripe melon essence in the nose. No matter which side of the pond you\u2019re on, here\u2019s to good beer and good friends. Cheers.",

American strong pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruityester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong.

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!",

From the recipes to the artwork on the labels, everything is designed by ourselves and our good friends.\r\n\r\nGypsy brewing means we are brewers without a permanent brewing home. We travel to other breweries, use their equipment to make something special, and bring the results back home to share. Think of Grimm Ales as a band, and the host brewery as a recording studio. We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013. Some of our first batches might be a crisp, spicy rye abbey ale, a rich, golden Belgian tripel, and a hop-focused pale ale made with clean, slightly acidic champagne yeast.",

                    "description": "Incorporated in December 2011, the Skull Coast Brewing Company, Inc., is a new entity formed for the express purpose of brewing and distributing handcrafted artisan ales, and whose history has yet to be written. Prior to its formation, Dave Fox launched and operated the Skull Coast Ale Company, a limited liability company (LLC.), located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, organized in 2009. Without the investment dollars needed to start his own brewery, the Skull Coast Ale Company operated as a \u201cContract Brewing\u201d or \u201cBeer Marketing\u201d company, in craft beer terms. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, the company contracted with other breweries to produce its beer recipes, and marketed the products under the Skull Coast name.\r\n\r\nAfter months of recipe development and searching for a brewery to contract with, Dave Fox brewed Skull Coast's first beer on St. Patrick's Day, 2010, in Virginia. The result was Maelstrom IPA; a true west coast style India Pale Ale, aggressively hopped with seven different Northwest hops. After months of traveling back and forth between South Carolina and Virginia to brew and transport kegs (roughly seven hours each way), Dave sought out a second contract brewing relationship closer to home. Unfortunately, every Carolina brewery Dave approached was at or near capacity. Undeterred, Dave created his own capacity. In the first of its kind contract model, Dave purchased his own 60bbl fermenter and bright tanks, and placed them in another brewery.\r\n\r\nThe Skull Coast Brewing Company is the continuation of a lifelong dream. The brand was born in a small Charleston library after looking at a local map drawn in the 1700's, during the Golden Age of Piracy, with the words \"Skull Coast\" etched along the Carolina coastline. The Skull Coast products matured and our understanding of the beer business was developed during our contract brewing experience, under the Skull Coast Ale Company. Now, with a new entity, our own facility and unrestricted in our growth, the Skull Coast Brewing Company hopes to become a lifelong part of your history.",

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the Ebel brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including a line of oak aged ales. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. Two Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.\r\n\r\nA whole family of great beer",

                    "description": "In the spring of 2010, Larry and Peter Geaghan began exploring the idea of expanding operations at Geaghan's Pub to include a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Maine.  Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.",

At a time when most breweries are scaling back hop usage due to price and limited availability, we've gone to the complete opposite end of the spectrum with Through Hiker! This unfiltered behemoth is loaded with American Cascade and Centennial hops in the boil and over THREE POUNDS of Cascade in the hop percolator! As if that weren't enough, we dry-hopped Through Hiker in the fermenter with even more Cascade hops!\r\n\r\nWhat does all this mean? 56 IBU's is what it means. At 13.5 Lovibond, Through Hiker is Amber in color with a slightly reddish hue due to the addition of Crystal malt and the ample addition of Cara-Pils malt. A full 20% of the grain bill consists of Weyermanns Rye malt which adds a spicy, full, viscous mouthfeel to the beer. Our total grain bill weighed out at just over 450 lbs. which adds up to 7.9% abv. so please drink responsibly, lamp shades on the head are SO yesterday...We'll be rolling out the red carpet for Through Hiker on Monday August 18th and it will only be available on site at the Woodstock Inn, Station and Brewery!",

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019. We believe we have.",
