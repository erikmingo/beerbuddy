A U.S. Army Ranger, Jim had just returned Stateside from Haiti when he attended a party hosted by Dr. Jack Blalock. At the soiree, he was introduced to a kindred soul named William Gantt. Their conversation soon turned to the quality of beer in Columbus. Needless to say, the tone was bitter and the language seasoned with expletives. When Jim explained that in Oregon, where he came of age, there was a vibrant scene of restaurants and bars that housed their own microbreweries that crafted their own distinct beers that could only be enjoyed at the source, Gantt understandably replied, \"$#@*!\".\r\n\r\nWhat began as a conversation soon became an obsession and, in 1996, the firm Warner and Worth was incorporated to see their shared dream come true.",

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

This medium-bodied beer is often brewed with rice, corn, wheat, or other grain or sugar adjuncts making up part of the mash. Hop bitterness is low to medium. Hop flavor and aroma are low. Residual malt sweetness is low--it does not predominate but may be perceived. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character, if perceived, are acceptable. There should be no chill haze.",

The plan was to bring original beer, original food, and original music to the area.\r\n\r\nNot only was Dogfish Head Delaware's first brewpub, it was the smallest commercial brewery in America. Our very first batch, Shelter Pale Ale, was brewed on a system which essentially was three little kegs with propane burners underneath. Brewing 12 gallon batches of beer for a whole restaurant proved to be more than a full time job. When the doors to the pub first opened, we brewed three times a day, five days a week! The one benefit to brewing on such a small system was the ability to try out a myriad of different recipes. We quickly got bored brewing the same things over and over that's when we started adding all sorts of weird ingredients and getting kind of crazy with the beers!",

Both the juice and the tea were added in the kettle during the whirlpool (after the boil) for maximum flavor and aroma contribution.  The Pear fruit complexity pierces right through the spicy Czech Saaz hops beautifully, adding a gentle acidity to this pale lager that makes for a crisp refreshing sipper.  Amarillo hops add nuanced citrus notes that meld perfectly with the fruit.",

Brazilians love this clear, crisp pilsner that goes down smooth, with a perfect amount of carbonation and enough flavor to to give it a little bite. Skol is a clear, straw colored pilsner with a thin white head and aromas of grain.\r\n\r\nWhether it is an advertisement on the beach, or a vendor selling ice-cold cans on the streets, Skol is found everywhere in Brazil. Because it\u2019s in such strong demand, you\u2019ll find it served in most restaurants, bars, clubs and retail establishments throughout the country.\r\n\r\nSkol is easy to drink, making it a perfect beer to drink with meat dishes and spicy food. An interesting feature of the Skol bottle is a small logo on the label, which turns blue when the beer is at its perfect temperature to drink. When the logo turn blue it says \"Skol Gelada\" (Skol is cold), to tell you when the beer is cold enough to drink.\r\n\r\nThe best Brazilian beer is now available in Australia, where it is gaining the popularity it enjoys at home. It can now be found at restaurants and premium bars in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.\r\n\r\nDRINK IT ICE COLD !",

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.",

One hundred and eighty five years have passed since then, with Pivovarna La\u0161ko growing from a local brewery to the leading producer of beer and together with other companies in the Group, into the leading producer of mineral and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages and other beverages on the Slovene market.\r\n\r\nBeverages production belongs to the more competitive industries, where multinational corporations, commercial companies and demanding users play the most important roles.\r\n\r\nPivovarna La\u0161ko and the La\u0161ko Group are embarking on a path of development with the following basic business orientation: to produce and sell innovative trendy products, maintain the market position of its own brand names on the domestic market and to attain again and expand positions in foreign markets achieved in the past.\u00a0 Furthermore, to use the most advanced technology in the development of appropriate production and commercial programs which guarantee the top quality of beer, non-alcoholic beverages and mineral and natural water.\r\n\r\nThe umbrella brand La\u0161ko is represented by the following products: the La\u0161ko Zlatorog, the special beers La\u0161ko Club, La\u0161ko Dark, and La\u0161ko Light,\u00a0 the light beer Export Pils and the sweet beverage La\u0161ko Malt with apple and peach flavours. In addition to the above brands Pivovarna La\u0161ko also produces the Bandidos product line, a beer with added aromas and in three different flavours: Bandidos Tequila, Bandidos Ice and Bandidos Sun. The Bandidos brand image was entirely renewed in spring 2010 to get even closer to its target population.\r\n\r\nFor special occasions Pivovarna La\u0161ko brews unique beers, such as the Jubilejnik and Eliksir beers. Pivovarna La\u0161ko entered an entirely new field in 2010, when it launched on the Slovenian market a novelty in the category of beverages, namely the apple cider, under the brand name iC Cider.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite the harsh market conditions Pivovarna La\u0161ko, d. d. maintained its position of leading beer producer in Slovenia.\r\n\r\nThe Pivovarna La\u0161ko Group today includes producers of beer, mineral, spring and natural waters, non-alcoholic beverages, spirits and other alcoholic drinks, and syrups for the productions of drinks, and also a newspaper and publishing activity.",
