                    "description": "Founded in 1986, the Abita Brewing Company is nestled in the piney woods 30 miles north of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIn its first year, the brewery produced 1,500 barrels of beer. We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 151,000 barrels of beer and 9,100 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.",

It will also give the beer a cloudy appearance. It is hopped with German Perle hops and spiced with lemon peels. This will impart a slightly citric flavor and aroma. This blends well with the natural flavors from the yeast but are not overpowering. The flavors become subdued and more balanced during the three-month aging process.",

The Allagash story, however, has roots that go much further back then the ten years the Portland, Maine brewery has been in operation. The roots go into the early 1990?s when founder Rob Tod saw something missing in the American beer market. They are interwoven in the craft brewing movement that has allowed the creativity of brewers to flourish over the last twenty years, and those same roots have ties that go back centuries-to the monasteries of Belgium, whose own ancient brewing methods are now practiced today by the brewers of Allagash. Allagash began as a one-man operation, with Tod assuming all brewing duties in a small space located in a building on the outskirts of the maritime city of Portland. Tod had worked in brewery settings before and recognized a void within the craft brewing movement. While both German and British styles had become prevalent throughout the U.S., the ever-creative Belgian-styles were very difficult to find. Through his travels, Tod had sampled many of these unique beers and felt that the flavors and traditions of this European nation needed to be shared with the American drinking public. He designed a small 15-barrel brewhouse specifically to embrace the Belgian tradition of beer making, gathered the finest array of authentic raw materials and began his quest towards the production of traditional Belgian style ales.",

It was hopped using only Alsatian Brewers Gold . It was then fermented with our house yeast at a lower than typical temperature, resulting in a more subdued ester profile than expressed in our other house yeast beers. Primary fermentation was followed by a cold maturation or \"garding\" period of six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe resulting beer is a medium amber colored ale with a smooth lager quality. The aroma presents a complex earthiness and toasted grains, balanced by a fruity candied grape character. The full body highlights a rounded maltiness accentuated by both nutty notes, and spicy hop flavors. The finish is remarkably dry with a wine-like character and light tannins.",

                    "description": "The three founders of Tin Whiskers Brewing Co., LLC are George Kellerman, Jake Johnson, and Jeff Moriarty. They first met in 2005 while going to the University of Minnesota for bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering. Over time, they all worked together as hardware design engineers for a small engineering services company specializing in RF-centric products. Being young engineers working downtown Minneapolis, they attended various happy hours together. It quickly became clear that they all really loved craft beer and were very intrigued with the science of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nJake and Jeff are the two brewers of the company who designed and honed the recipes. They got their start in 2006 brewing extract kits on Jake's Mom's kitchen stove much to her chagrin. (A few boil-overs did occur on her stove, whoops!) They brewed countless extract kits until in 2010, when after touring Surly and Flat Earth, they were inspired to turn their passion (like the founders of those breweries) into a business. From that point forward it has been all grain brewing and loving it. Nowadays, Jake focuses on the brewing aspect of the business while Jeff focuses on the brewing as well as the business side of the operation.\r\n\r\nGeorge, in the early years, was a force within the brewery by helping out at every brew session and providing needed muscle for cleaning and moving material around the brewhouse. He focused a lot on the quality of our beer and pushed us to design better more complex beers. He has moved on to be in charge of our online presence including developing our own beer wiki engine.",

We go into the studio from time to time and make an album (or a beer, rather!).\r\n\r\nEach batch of beer will be a one-of-a-kind, seasonal, limited edition brew. If you like a particular beer we release, drink it up -- it may never come back around again!\r\n\r\nExpect our first beers to pop up in New York in summer 2013.

Belle is loaded with layers of complex flavors while maintaining a well-rounded balance.",

Our aim was to create a beer bursting with cocoa flavors and aromas, balancing sweet and savory to create a complex but quaffable chocolate brew. To accomplish this we partnered with Dandelion Chocolate in San Francisco to create this rich brew brimming with chocolate character. Working with the unique flavors of Dandelion\u2019s single-source beans, we created this decadent beer by layering in smoked and dark-roasted malts with citrusy Ivanhoe hops from Clearlake, CA. Finally, we added a blend of hand-roasted cocoa beans sourced from Madagascar and R\u00edo Caribe, Venezuela. The Madagascar beans add bright berry-cocoa flavors, while the R\u00edo Caribe adds dark chocolate and bourbon notes. A touch of vanilla rounds out the supporting flavors to create an eminently drinkable beer that is a chocolate lover\u2019s beer through and through.", 
            "foodPairings": "Biere de Chocolat balances the sweet and savory characteristics of chocolate to create a robust ale that pairs well with a variety of dishes. Serve with Texas style BBQ brisket to bring out the subtle smoked-malt flavors or show off chocolate\u2019s savory side with a classic Mexican chicken mole. This beer loves dessert, too: pair simply with pieces of Dandelion\u2019s Single Origin Chocolate bars to compare and contrast the tastable terroir of their different single-source beans.",

Traditionally American brewers would add a portion of corn to lighten up the body in cream ales. I choose to take this a different direction by adding clear Belgian candied syrup.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

The first \u2018brassin\u2019 (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982.\r\n\r\nThe elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our \u2018nectar\u2019 from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the summer of 2006 the founders of the Brewery chose to entrust the future of their dear elves to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery. The group\u2019s wish is to invest in Achouffe and to develop the full potential of the Brewery.",

However, in recent years, it has been discovered that these hops are genetically distinct from the German landrace and in fact are most likely Fuggle or a closely related hop. The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

Fruity esters can be light to medium in intensity. Flavor of alcohol is evident. Earthy, cellarlike, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived but chill haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character. French-Style Bi\u00e9re de Garde may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

These farmhouse ales are historically crafted with Pilsner, Munich, and a large dose of wheat malt that lends the beer a distinct, Spring-like quality. Biere de Mars are traditionally crafted at the beginning of winter with the farm\u2019s freshest crop of barley, wheat and hops. The farm\u2019s brewers then spend months aging what they consider their finest beer of the year.\u201d Our Courir de Mardi Gras is seasonally brewed and released for all of your pre-Lenten, Mardi Gras celebrations \u2013 whether you are chasing plastic beads and doubloons at a parade or a live chicken in a muddy field.",

The Louisville area has had a number of quality brewpubs for some time now, but still there was simply not enough beer! Against the Grain is an effort to help solve this problem. We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window. We aren't just another brewpub. We are Against the Grain!",

The recipe was written by Jim Azotea of the Saratoga Thoroughbrews for use on a homebrew system, and scaled up by him to a 7-barrel batch. The alcohol warmth also comes through, which is very unusual for a Davidson Brothers Ale. There is also a moderate caramel sweetness from the sugar added during the boil. The low hop aroma is characteristic of noble hops, with very low bitterness and moderate aroma. The overall impression is of a sweet, caramel, amber ale, with low hop aroma and a noticeable alcohol burn. Expect to see it in late May or early June.",

There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.",

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.",

One King brought Gold, the other Frankincense and the other Myrrh. Many breweries produce a Christmas Seasonal beer and this is our beer to celebrate the holiday season.\r\n\r\nGold in color and bittered with the bark of Frankincense, we have even used the smallest amount of Myrrh which is an herb that has roots in ancient winemaking as well.\r\n\r\nThe beer starts off with an initial malt sweetness that fades into a firm but subtle hop presence. The lager yeast and cold maturation ensure a crisp smooth finish. As the beer matures, the Brettanomyces added at bottling will become more pronounced and a drier beer will evolve.",

High ceilings, dark grain wood, exposed brick and rich character. We highlight the history of the building without it becoming an intrusive element. Our style is simplistic and straight forward, both in atmosphere and menu. We're right in the middle of a bustling downtown that sits along a beautiful river which our large deck overlooks for an incredible outdoor dining experience in the Summer months. Or heck, a pint during a snowstorm. Our hope is to provide you with a great meal, great beer and outstanding service in a laid-back atmosphere. A mellow, all-encompassing brewpub experience.",

This has now expanded to include Bombshell Blonde(12oz cans) and Buried Hatchet Stout(12oz cans), but both are also kegged. These will just be a few of the ales we will be offering as we expand into seasonal batches, plus we just started our PRO-AM line of brews where home brewers can compete to have their recipe produced at our brewery(with the help of the creators if they desire). The winning entry will also be entered into the GABF. \r\n\r\nThanks to the help of our five distributors, we are able to get our brews to a variety of locations(including grocery stores, beverage shops, pubs and restaurants) throughout Texas and a few other states including Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and South Carolina. Unfortunately due to laws in Texas we can't tell you where you can buy our beers, but we are working at trying to get them to as many of your favorite craft beer establishments as possible.",

Since then, we've grown into a regional craft brewery that employs more than 200 people over an 18 state area, in addition to Puerto Rico and Washington DC. The dedication to brewing flavorful, unfiltered, quality craft beers that started in 1985 is still with us today. We currently brew over 20 beers for distribution as well as many other small batch beers that are served at our pub in Kalamazoo, the Eccentric Cafe. Our ongoing goal is to brew thoughtfully, creatively and artistically. We strive to bring an authentic and pleasant experience to all of our customers through our unique ales and beers.",

We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window.

The idea for Black Acre initially was conceived in 2010 due to our love of brewing, great beer, and the beer community at large. We created Black Acre with the goal of contributing delicious and unique beers to the community in which we live.\r\n\r\nBlack Acre hand crafts its ales using a custom fabricated 3 barrel electric brewing system. The brewery will produce four house beers along with an ever rotating selection of seasonal and specialty beers. Distribution will be primarily though in house tap room sales although there will be limited outside distribution. Our beers are not ready quite yet, but stop by for a glass of one of our delicious guest taps and meet the staff.",

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.",

Many believe the source of that surge was from a passing flying saucer. Ovni (flying saucer in French) Ale commemorates the great craftsmanship that went into repairing the tower. This French style bier de garde is made with the finest imported malt and hops. This beer has a substantial malt character with a mild hop bitterness. Ovni Ale pairs well with bouillabaisse, wild game and pasta.",

We believe quality beers require quality ingredients and a painstaking attention to detail throughout the brewing process.  \r\n\r\nAdelbert\u2019s uses Bohemian old-world floor malted barley, low alpha Noble Czech hops, and fresh yeast propagated at the brewery. In our seven vessel brewhouse, we use a time consuming, multi-temperature decoction mash technique which extracts a more complex flavor from our grains.\r\n\r\nWe produce a gambit of hand-crafted Belgian style ales right here in Austin, Texas. With our vast array of beer styles, you're sure to find a brew that suits you.\r\n \r\nOur Belgian-Style Ales include:\r\nRambler Blonde\r\nNaked Nun Wit\r\nBlack Rhino Black Ale\r\nScratchin' Hippo Biere de Garde\r\nPhilosophizer Saison\r\nDancin' Monks Dubbel Ale\r\nTripel B Tripel Ale\r\nFlyin' Monks Quadrupel Ale\r\n \r\nAlso, look for our Barrel-Aged \"Vintage Series\" where we age one of our eight ales in oak barrels for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough our selection of beer is great to enjoy by itself; each of them also pair perfectly with just about any food. From spicy Thai food to a backyard barbecue with ribs and brisket, to a formal dinner with steak or seafood and a dark chocolate dessert; our artisanal Belgian-style ales go with pretty much everything. Please share pictures and recipes that you've either used our beer to cook with or have enjoyed right alongside them!",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

            "description": "Veranda has a wonderfully complex aroma that stems from its blend yeast strains. The aroma is of green pepper, with some spiciness and dry dark fruits like raisins, plums and dates. The flavor has a supporting caramel malt that mixes with the slight toffee sweetness. The finish is fairly dry making it that much easier to drink and even though it is a big beer you would never know it. Staying true to style, Veranda has a slightly oxidized taste giving it somewhat of a rustic flavor.", 
            "foodPairings": "Pairing universally with most main dishes, our French Ale is best complimented with roast beef, lamb or fresh game. You may enjoy the combination better if you grill or roast these meats, however don\u2019t get too carried away with the grilling for too much darkening may take away the delicate balance of this beer. Select cheeses that are rich and moderately aged like double Gloucester. For dessert try spiced rum walnut tart or toffee apple crisp.",

This style of beer is characterized by a toasted malt aroma, slight malt sweetness in flavor, and low to medium hop bitterness. Noble-type hop aromas and flavors should be low to medium. Fruity esters can be light to medium in intensity. Flavor of alcohol is evident. Earthy, cellarlike, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived but chill haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character. French-Style Bi\u00e9re de Garde may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",
