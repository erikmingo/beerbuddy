K\u00f6lsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.",

At the same time we all dreamed of living in an area of Colorado that would allow us to sneak out of the brewhouse to catch a four-pound trout, hike a 14,000-foot peak, or slash through some of Colorado\u2019s famous powder. In the winter of 2011 we made our dreams a reality and took the leap and started brewing in Poncha Springs, Colorado.",

The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

Historically, hops from Saaz (?atec) were considered among the finest in Europe, and were the backbone of the original Bohemian Pilsner; ?atec (Saaz in German) is in the area in NW part of Bohemia of the modern-day Czech Republic. In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner. Although the traditional name for this hop would be Saazer (or Saaz Saazer when grown in the Saaz area), it is generally simply referred to as Saaz or Czech Saaz. zech Saaz is grown not only in ?atec area but also in Tr?ice area (Central Moravia) and ?st? n/L area (North Bohemia). Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American). True Saaz Saazer hops are prized for their mild, pleasant flavor, and are the only choice for brewing an authentic Pilsner.",

                    "description": "Alaska has a rich history of brewing. From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",

Training and competing in track and road running events brought them together. They soon found another shared interest--experiencing the world of beer. The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born. Just a few months later, their dreams came to fruition at 7929 Victoria Drive. ENKI\u2019s mission is to \u201cMake the World a Friendlier Place \u2013 Two Beers at a Time\u201d just as John and Dan have been enjoying and sharing beers with old and new friends, alike.",

This guiding philosophy encompasses everything that we do. We use only the best: premium hops and malts combined with our own cultured yeast strains. Our fourth and final ingredient is the pure, natural mountain water sourced from the great Canadian Rockies. Unlike most commercial breweries, we do nothing to our water but remove the chlorine added to it. Our fresh beer is made with real glacial water and all the minerals that come with it!\r\n\r\nThe premium beers that we brew have grown from roots grounded deeply in tradition. Our dedicated Brewmaster uses time-tested recipes and brewing methods in our traditional, English-style brewery. Our hops and malts are sourced from around the world as to provide true styles with the unique twist of glacial water. This combination yields beers that are absolutely the best that they can be.\r\n\r\nOur beers are for everyone. They are fresh, modern, and innovatively looking to the future. They are true and honest, drawing on experience from the past. We truly believe there is an occasion for every beer and a beer for every occasion.",

This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree\u2019s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery\u2026well, that\u2019s our story at Barrelhouse and we can\u2019t exactly prove it, but we\u2019re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.  We think it makes a sweet logo, too!\r\n\r\nAfter you pass the old oak, make a left on Limestone Way and look for the dragon fly\u2026you can\u2019t miss it. \r\n\r\nStop by, grab a brew or two and relax.  Enjoy our glorious beer gardens with friends while you listen to the waterfall and experience the central coast the way it was meant to be enjoyed\u2026outside.  You can also pull up to the bar inside the brewery where you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re part of the brewing action. Along with our amazing line-up of beers, we will also feature our very own custom crafted rootbeers.  If you ask nicely, we can even float a scoop of ice cream in your favorite sarsaparilla or stout.",

It embodies subtle notes of the pear and a yeastiness characteristic of a traditional Kolsch, yet slightly hoppy. Its body is light and fruity, complimented by mild pepper and gooseberry notes from the Nelson Sauvin hops. We kept it light and refreshing and gave it a dry, almost tart finish.",

Brewmaster Christian Ettinger has spent the past year and half constructing his dream brewpub.  HUB incorporates all aspects of sustainability.  From composting to rain barrels, and from pervious pavers to hand dryers, we have made every effort to protect our future with a thoughtful alternative.  Hopworks has four distinct areas including a family friendly restaurant with play area, a vibrant bicycle bar, banquet mezzanine, and outdoor beer-garden.  Our 20 barrel brewery produces 3000 barrels a year and provides our restaurant with ten different HUB organic beers on tap and two cask ales at all times. We have parking for seventy cars, eight motorcycles and up to fifty bikes.  Our world-class beer, New York style pizza, and wonderful staff are some of the best you will find anywhere.",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!",

Because we believe that craft beer is best enjoyed fresh, Twisted Pine ales can only be found throughout Colorado.

It is our intention to bring to you a select family of individually distinctive ales that we as brewers would enjoy drinking ourselves. That is our final measure. We ignore costs, fads, and difficulty in creating our ales. And, while we are very serious about the art and business of beer making, we try to avoid taking ourselves too seriously. After all, we realize brewing a fine beer isn't exactly nuclear physics. It's something far more important. -Twistedpine.com",

K\u00f6lsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

The challenge was to take our combined skills and create a brewpub that excels in providing tasty beers, inspired food, and excellent customer service.  After meeting in college, the group entered the work place to refine the skills required to create and operate a successful brewpub.  In January of 2010, with inspired council from family, Paul Coggins relocated to Georgia to focus the group on one purpose.  With the help of God, the group was charged to create the best dining experience for the community.  After many months of construction, permitting, setbacks, and discoveries; Toasted and Tapped opened its doors to the public on November 26th, 2010.  We at Toasted and Tapped are excited to offer the best food, beer, and service we can to the community which gives us so much.",

In other words we can\u2019t produce a TON of beer, but we can make it the highest quality.",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all. Chill haze should be absent.",

That is why as of October 1, 2012 we became The Tap Brewing Company!\r\n\r\nThe Tap Brewing Company is located inside a nearly 120 year old mill that at one point was the epicenter of Haverhill's massive shoe manufacturing industry. High ceilings, dark grain wood, exposed brick and rich character. We highlight the history of the building without it becoming an intrusive element. Our style is simplistic and straight forward, both in atmosphere and menu. We're right in the middle of a bustling downtown that sits along a beautiful river which our large deck overlooks for an incredible outdoor dining experience in the Summer months. Or heck, a pint during a snowstorm. Our hope is to provide you with a great meal, great beer and outstanding service in a laid-back atmosphere. A mellow, all-encompassing brewpub experience.",

The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

Our mission was to make beer that called to mind three things: quality, purity, and sanity.\r\n\r\nThat's why we make our ales using only natural ingredients. You will find us on draught and in bottles at fabulous bars and restaurants throughout the state as well as in six packs at your favorite liquor store. So, if you\r\nshould get your hands on a Bristol beer, know that it was brewed fresh no more than a few hours from where you're sitting.\r\n\r\nWe take extra care to make our beers better because we like to drink them. We hope you will, too.",

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the Ebel brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including a line of oak aged ales. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. Two Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.\r\n\r\nA whole family of great beer",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019. We believe we have.",

It is widely believed that she was so beautiful, no man could resist her.  So, perhaps not surprisingly, with a long-absent husband, and a wealth of potential suitors, she also had a reputation for being promiscuous!  We don\u2019t like to consider her name-sake beer to be \u2018promiscuous\u2019 so much as \u2018versatile\u2019 because, much like Freya, our Kolsch-style Ale has a wealth of suitors and enjoys pairing with many of them.\r\n\r\nFreya\u2019s Gold \u2013 Kolsch Style Ale is a light, crisp and refreshing ale. Like the traditional Kolsch style that originated in Koln, Germany, this ale goes through a long cold conditioning phase (much like a lager) to blend and smooth out the flavors. This results in a very drinkable beer with a clean body and mild flavors. Freya\u2019s Gold is also balanced with acidulated malt and brewed with a touch of ginger to give a unique taste and drinking experience.",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

As our passion developed we moved to up onto the Boise bench in 2002.\r\nOur humble beginnings started with just a four barrel brewing system. In 2009 we upgraded to seven barrels.\r\nThen the microbrew scene exploded, and in 2011 we\u2019re proud to report we produced 1,500 barrels of small batch, hand crafted excellence.\r\nWe owe our success to faithful Idahoans and wonderful boise patrons. To match demand, we\u2019re moving to a new location, breaking ground on west Fairview and Cloverdale.\r\nOur new location will be 12,000 square feet, with a twenty barrel brewing system in place. This will allow for 3,000 barrel production per year.",

Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, brewmaster Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

Their love of beer and the quest for mountain living lured them to move to Revelstoke to create the brewery in 1996. Bart has a Phd in nuclear physics, but he prefers to make beer not war, right here in Revelstoke. And Bart hasn't let all that education stop him from making great beer. In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \r\n\r\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \r\n\r\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings. Most significantly, the brewery moved to a larger location downtown, in an old car dealership, which now includes a tasting area and retail space.",

                    "description": "Rogue Ales was founded in 1988 by Jack Joyce, Rob Strasser and Bob Woodell, three corporate types who wanted to go into the food/beverage industry. Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

                    "description": "Uinta Brewing Company embarked upon its mission of brewing world class, full-flavored, craft-brewed beer in the winter of 1993. From a small, renovated mechanic\u2019s garage located in Salt Lake City, Uinta began distributing a tasty variety of beer ranging from 4.0% to over 10% alcohol by volume to local bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Demand escalated, resulting in the installation of a bottling line in 1996. Then, in 2001, having outgrown its original building, Uinta built and relocated to a 26,000-square-foot facility, specifically designed for brewing beer. \r\nUinta Brewing is named after an east-west mountain range located in northeastern Utah. Many of Uinta\u2019s beer names are inspired by Utah\u2019s diverse landscapes or have historical significance. Cutthroat Pale Ale, Uinta\u2019s flagship beer, is named after Utah\u2019s state fish. Subsequent beer names followed suit, such as King's Peak Porter, named after Utah\u2019s highest peak, Golden Spike Hefeweizen, named after the spike used to commemorate the completion of the transcontinental railroad in Utah, and Dubhe, named after the Utah Centennial star.\r\nIn desire of creating a different experience in beer, Uinta launched its Crooked Line in 2010. These beers were dubbed \u201cbig beers\u201d both in taste, alcohol content (ranging from 9 to over 13% alcohol by volume) and size of bottle.  Crooked Line beers are packaged in 750 ml bottles and are cork finished. Knowing that each beer was quite different from the next, it was essential that each brew showcased its individuality outside the bottle as well. Uinta sought the talents of local artists to design the labels, assuring that each style was unique in packaging as well as in style and taste. The launch of the Crooked Line was quickly followed by the grand opening of the Little Big Beer Store\u2014an on-site store selling higher alcohol content beers\u2014refrigerated!\r\nInspired by an upcoming 20th anniversary, Uinta Brewery sought a fresh approach in showcasing its products while maintaining the classic Uinta feel which reflects an appreciation for the outdoors and characteristics of the mountain west.  Uinta Brewing spent most of 2010-2011 going through a massive redesign of its logo, labels, all packaging and its bottle. The process enabled Uinta to clearly organize and define three lines of beers under the Uinta Family:  The Classic Line, Organic Line and Crooked Line. \r\nUinta designed a custom, proprietary 12 ounce bottle as part of the redesign project. Referred to as the \u201ccompass bottle,\u201d the new bottle shape is branded by a 360-degree compass embossed into the bottle\u2019s shoulder.  The upshot?  You\u2019ll never get lost with a Uinta bottle in hand!  Naturally, adopting the custom-shaped bottle gave rise to the need for a substantial investment in new bottling line equipment.\r\nThe redesigned logo embodies the uniqueness of the company\u2019s namesake, the Uinta Mountains.  A compass is integrated into the logo with the needle pointing East-West, referencing the only major range facing East-West in the continental U.S.. The compass also speaks to Uinta\u2019s sense of exploration and direction as Uinta consistently strives to brew the best beer possible. \u201cEarth, Wind and Beer\u201d remains part of the logo referring to Uinta\u2019s long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship. \r\nSince 2001 Uinta Brewing has been 100% wind-powered, becoming the first Utah company to reach this mark. In an effort to continue its commitment to using renewable resources, Uinta Brewing installed solar-electric paneling on the brewery\u2019s roof in 2011.  \r\n Uinta beers have received awards and medals from regional, national, and international competitions, including the North American Beer Awards, World Beer Cup, and Great American Beer Festival. \r\nUinta is committed to brewing world-class beer using the best practices and ingredients.",

Owner and brewer Paul Wright began his brewing adventures after receiving a homebrew kit for Christmas in 1991 in Novato, CA. He joined the local brew club and started winning awards for his beers. Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way. We\u2019ve now opened a new brewery in beautiful downtown Carpinteria and hope you\u2019ll stop by to visit soon.",

We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",

Brewing in a renovated dairy barn, we brew American-style farmhouse ales with German, English and Belgian influences. Water is taken from our own springs and lends to our signature flavor. Our beer is made with natural ingredients and no pretense. We've been known to throw in a few spices or fruits into our beer. Our most popular beer, Pork Slap Pale Ale is sweet and malty, brewed with fresh ginger root. Heinnieweisse is a German-style weissebier with tart citrus and banana notes. For all our hopheads, Snapperhead is an American IPA with light spicy and earthy hop flavors. And don't forget about Moo Thunder American Stout with its espresso, dark chocolate, smoky flavor.\r\nWe change up the beer on draft pretty regularly, so stop by often. You can sample all our year-round brews, plus any specialty styles we have on draft. Take a tour of our brewery and learn about the brewing process, ingredients and history. Our beer is available for sale in 6-packs or cases and don't forget to bring your growler.",

Wormtown Punk Punk Press was gobbled up by the musicians and music fans of Worcester who craved news and information about the exciting sounds emanating from the local airwaves and rock clubs. Wormtown Punk Punk Press featured groups from Worcester like the Blue Moon Band and Crazy Jack, and from Boston like Willie Alexander, DMZ and The Real Kids. The 'zine hit a nerve in the city and those who were entranced with punk picked up on the name Wormtown and adopted it quickly to represent themselves and their emerging culture. Within a year an album showcasing the city's best punk bands entitled Wormtown '78 was produced, effectively branding the local music scene, and the city of Worcester, forever.\r\n\r\n?Not everyone identifies with Wormtown. Not everyone is involved with the underground music scene in the city, not everyone is a fan of punk. But the name has stuck and has been adopted by countless Worcester citizens because it symbolizes and embraces the free spirited do-it-yourself ethic that is simply Worcester. Over the years it has meant many things to many people and sometimes frowned upon as derogatory by some, when actually it helped change the culture of the city in a way where anyone could strike out on their own and create music, art or a collective of liked minded individuals. Wormtown Brewery has that same spirit - they are creating something unique to add to the mix in our city. Will it change Worcester the way music did back in the late '70s? Who knows. But one thing is for sure, there is nothing that goes better with good music than good beer.",

The Kolsch style is one of the lesser known German Ales. Made with 100% authentic ingredients including Kolsch yeast from our friends at Gardner Ale House. Light golden in color with light malt aroma, background fruitiness and hints of sulfur. Soft malt flavor is complimented by light fruitiness that is washed away with noble hop bitterness and a slightly dry finish. Very comparable to Pilsner or other European Lagers in most aspects.",

So, it was a natural for us to revive the brewery that has been in Lexington since 1794. Welcome and enjoy.",

However, in recent years, it has been discovered that these hops are genetically distinct from the German landrace and in fact are most likely Fuggle or a closely related hop. The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.",

Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to\u2026A madman\u2019s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.\r\n \r\nTrue patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around.

Upstreams K\u00f6bes K\u00f6lsch appearance is pale straw-colored and clear. The taste is delicate and refreshing, with a light distinct hop flavor from the traditional German hallertau mittelfruh hops, gently fruitier and a little sweeter, with a delightful biscuityness. Upstreams K\u00f6lsch uses pale barley malt, & malted wheat. The result is a refreshing cool beer, ideal for summer afternoons.",

They spent many long nights building most of the current brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipies.  More than ten years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued on a much larger scale.  In the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Recently, Ron Kutella and Chris Justema joined the parternship and what started as one brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge.",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

A group of businessmen incorporated Shiner Brewing Association and placed Herman Weiss in as the company's first brewmaster. In 1914 a German immigrant brewer named Kosmas (or Kosmos) Spoetzl co-leased with Oswald Petzold with an option to buy in 1915. Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.",

After some early batches with extracts, it took less than a year to trade up to all-grain brewing in a friend's basement apartment. The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue. Dan tried his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he's quenched the thirst of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks who live in Beervana for a reason. After a slight detour for law school and the cat-herding world of criminal defense, Dan swapped his back-porch setup for a bigger set of kettles and fermenters.",

The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company",

Ours is a \"brewers' brewery\", with an uncompromising focus on beer quality.\r\n\r\n From the beginning, our goal was to make beers that we liked to drink. All of our beers are served up unfiltered and long-aged, to deliver maximum flavor and character. The beers can be very complex and assertive, but with the ultimate goal of proper balance. We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.",

Utilizing German malted barley from a malt-house situated outside K\u00f6ln and dry hopped with outstanding Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops, this light bodied golden beer is oak aged (lagered) for six weeks on French Oak.",

To further enhance the crisp qualities imparted by this unique yeast, we use wheat as part of the grain bill and the slightly spicy and crisp German Tetnang hops.

Our selection of hand crafted lagers and ales are produced on premises using the finest grains and hops. We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite. Please let Bob or Donna, or any of the High Desert Brewing Co. staff know how you think we are doing.",

We also have the opportunity to share our love of beer with visitors who drop by to watch us work, sample our wares or just have a chat. We make a large range of beers with a huge range of colours, aromas & flavours & we firmly believe there is a beer in there for everyone \u2013 and the only real way to find out is by visiting us and tasting the beer!\r\n \r\nOur brewery is very small, one of the smallest in the country. We strive to create a beer experience for our customers. Visit the brewery, chat to a brewer, watch us at work - the person who made the beer will be pouring the beer for you to enjoy!\r\n \r\nMost of our beer is sold on-site, but if you are unable to visit us our beer is available in other locations (several restaurants, pubs and bottleshops) or you can order on-line .",

            "description": "Another German beer that emerged after the availability of lighter colored malts, K\u00f6lsch is one of Germany's newest beer styles. Originating in Cologne (K\u00f6ln in German, both the dialect spoken and a person hailing from that city are called 'K\u00f6lsch'), K\u00f6lsch is a modern descendant of the Medieval Rhenish Ale brewed throughout the region north of Munich, a distinction it shares with the nearby Dusseld\u00f6rf Alt (you will hear more about this style in the near future). As demand for light colored beers grew, Cologne's brewers first developed a beer brewed mostly with wheat, quite similar to the German Weisse, called 'Keutebier'. Probably similar to a Belgian Wit, but lacking that beer's spices, Keutebier dominated brewing production in Cologne for almost 300 years. It wasn't until the 19th century that wheat started to disappear from the recipe, gradually replaced by Pilsner, until Keutebier had morphed into the modern K\u00f6lsch. 1906 is generally credited as the year modern K\u00f6lsch was first brewed by the S\u00fcnner Brewery. This new beer's popularity grew quickly, inspiring many brewers throughout the area to brew something similar. In 1946, the first agreement was signed by participating brewers that defined K\u00f6lsch. Throughout a turbulent history, many more agreements and legal battles have been waged until K\u00f6lsch was finally recognized by the EU with regional protections similar to those enjoyed by wine. Today a true K\u00f6lsch is brewed only in Cologne or the immediate area, but beers inspired by K\u00f6lsch are brewed all over the world. Clandestine's 'K\u00f6lsch I Can' is brewed with the same spirit as its German cousins: it is a subtle, malty, clean, crisp ale that has been lagered to reach peak flavors. Respectful of tradition, this beer is brewed only with German malts and hops. Soft water is used to push the malt flavors to the forefront of this still delicate beer. Just in time for hot weather, this is a perfect lawnmower beer!",

We are also focused on bringing sessionable craft beer to everyone. The biggest trend, and subsequent impediment, in craft/micro brewing is the almost obsessive need to make the biggest, hoppiest, strangest beer possible, which is great for advancing the boundaries of what can be done with beer but does not satisfy a daily thirst. We pride ourselves on making great beer, with all the flavor one could want, that people will actually want to drink whenever and with whatever. Again, great doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\r\n\r\nAnother of our fundamental ideas is that brewing is free, and should be open. So, with this in mind, we will share as many of our \u201csecrets\u201d as possible with everyone so that they too can make great beer at home. If you ever have questions please reach out, we are more than happy to share what we know! (Seriously, we will talk about brewing and all of it\u2019s components for hours\u2026love this stuff.)",

That is why, when you do see it, it is mostly \u201cK\u00f6lsch Style\u201d instead of just \u201cK\u00f6lsch\u201d. We understand Cologne, it is a truly good style of beer with all the light flavors that you would expect in a pilsner and only half the trouble to make. We are only troubled by the fact that because you regulated this style most of the rest of the world hasn\u2019t heard of it. We are here to change that, whether you like it or not.  We took the traditional \u201cK\u00f6lsch Style\u201d and worked it up a bit with some special hop additions. We did not go noble with the hop profile but instead took it in a direction that paired better with the bready flavor of the pilsen and the touch of wheat grains that make up the back bone of this brew. This style is perfect on those hot summer days, but it\u2019s is also so refreshing that it is great anytime. So good in fact that it may coin the phrase \u201cEventide Style K\u00f6lsch\u201d, and don\u2019t worry Cologne, we\u2019ll let you call it that too.",

K\u00f6lsch is characterized by a golden to straw color and a slightly dry, subtly sweet softness on the palate, yet crisp. Good, dense head retention is desirable. Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

As a nano-brewery, we make less than one barrel of beer per batch and therefore cannot produce nearly the quantity as other breweries around. It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.",

From their website:\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re fiercely independent. Our beer and our brewery is a labour of love from start to finish. There were no deep pockets behind us when we launched and there aren\u2019t any now either. Our success is derived from hard work, unbridled passion and the support from customers who appreciate these qualities and a well made beer.\r\n\r\nWhile we take great care in making the best beer possible, we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We go out of our way to take any pretense out of our beer. We believe in rustic, natural quality over fancy-pants snobbery. Our marketing and branding efforts try to reinforce this and we choose to market by talking to folks instead of blaring messages through mass-market advertising.",

Geneva Lake measures in at 21 miles around and 2.6 miles at its widest point; making it the second largest lake in Wisconsin. If you are looking for something a little 'slimmer'; our Kolsch is named for the narrowest part of the lake measuring in at .5 miles across. When you are in the mood for something light but packed with flavor; this is the beer for you.",

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish. And for those of you with a sweet tooth we make a fantastic Root Beer!",

Building on his talents as both chef & restaurateur, Matt\u2019s canvas is no longer a plate of food but a pint of beer. Blending the purest water with the finest Oregon hops Matt then filters the beer for clarity, resulting in the perfect pint. \r\n\r\nHere at Phat Matt\u2019s we fully embrace the philosophy that beer is for every occasion, anytime, anywhere.",

It continued production until prohibition in 1920. Its award winning ales were well known in the Northeast and were even exported to England and France. Production levels peaked in 1915 when 65,000 barrels of beer were produced at the Hudson Facility.\r\n\r\nThe brewery bottled its own beer in Hudson at one of the country\u2019s earliest bottling facilities (1889) and later at a plant in New York City. The family also malted much of their own grain in their malt houses at the Hudson facility. Neil Evans revives this rich heritage here at the Albany Pump Station. Surviving C.H. Evans Brewing Company memorabilia is displayed in the new facility, as well as pictures of the pump station as it appeared at the turn of the century.",

                    "description": "During the period of promoterism \u2013 at the end oft he 19th century \u2013 the breweries in Cologne sprang up like mushrooms. In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 then called OBERG\u00c4RIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) \u2013 was founded in the Cologne quarter \u201cSeverinsviertel\u201d in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich \u2013 today a quarter of Bergheim/Erft \u2013 as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name K\u00f6lsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called \u201cWiess\u201d. After Heinrich\u2019s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Rei\u00dfdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Rei\u00dfdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Rei\u00dfdorf.\r\n\r\nWhen the product range was diversified to further styles of beer \u2013 M\u00e4rzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen \u2013 in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich\u2019s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a \u201cEinfachbier\u201d (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation.\r\n\r\nDue to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.\r\n\r\nContinuity and a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the highly competitive K\u00f6lsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.",

They even had a style in mind - Kolsch.  Kolsch proper is a blond-colored Ale brewed in the city of Koln.  It is then stored (lagered) for some time to mellow the brew and in many aspects it resembles its lager brothers and sisters.  Mike and I worked with Jon on the recipe keeping the Kolsch philosophy- sprinkled a few more hops in- and I think the end result is pretty darn good.  Bier Royale checks in at 5%, was built from Pale Ale, Pils, Vienna, and Wheat malts, and spiced with Hops from Tettnang which give it that 35 IBU bedonkedonk.  Cheers!  Prost!  Excelsior!",

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.",

A classic K\u00f6lsch is less bitter than a pilsner with a slightly fruity and sweet biscuit note. For our version we wanted to create a bright fresh flavor by using Alsatian Strisselspalt hops for a subtle lemon and grassy hop note. We added another layer of flavor by aging the beer on a bed of Jasmine Sambac, a fragrant night blooming flower from Southeast Asia. The jasmine creates a delicate floral aroma and flavor for a wonderfully complex and refreshing brew.",

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

A group of businessmen incorporated Shiner Brewing Association and placed Herman Weiss in as the company's first brewmaster. In 1914 a German immigrant brewer named Kosmas (or Kosmos) Spoetzl co-leased with Oswald Petzold with an option to buy in 1915. Spoetzl had attended brewmaster's school and apprenticed for three years in Germany, worked for eight years at the Pyramids Brewery in Cairo, Egypt, and then worked in Canada. He moved to San Antonio in search of a better climate for his health, bringing with him a family recipe for a Bavarian beer made from malted barley and hops.",

He produces a wide variety of beers, from the light, refreshing Siskiyou Golden Ale to the deep, impenetrable Black Bear Double Stout, which won the Gold Medal at the 2003 GABF and the Silver Medal in 2006 and 2008 in the foreign-style stout category.

                    "description": "Uinta Brewing Company embarked upon its mission of brewing world class, full-flavored, craft-brewed beer in the winter of 1993. From a small, renovated mechanic\u2019s garage located in Salt Lake City, Uinta began distributing a tasty variety of beer ranging from 4.0% to over 10% alcohol by volume to local bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Demand escalated, resulting in the installation of a bottling line in 1996. Then, in 2001, having outgrown its original building, Uinta built and relocated to a 26,000-square-foot facility, specifically designed for brewing beer. \r\nUinta Brewing is named after an east-west mountain range located in northeastern Utah. Many of Uinta\u2019s beer names are inspired by Utah\u2019s diverse landscapes or have historical significance. Cutthroat Pale Ale, Uinta\u2019s flagship beer, is named after Utah\u2019s state fish. Subsequent beer names followed suit, such as King's Peak Porter, named after Utah\u2019s highest peak, Golden Spike Hefeweizen, named after the spike used to commemorate the completion of the transcontinental railroad in Utah, and Dubhe, named after the Utah Centennial star.\r\nIn desire of creating a different experience in beer, Uinta launched its Crooked Line in 2010. These beers were dubbed \u201cbig beers\u201d both in taste, alcohol content (ranging from 9 to over 13% alcohol by volume) and size of bottle.  Crooked Line beers are packaged in 750 ml bottles and are cork finished. Knowing that each beer was quite different from the next, it was essential that each brew showcased its individuality outside the bottle as well. Uinta sought the talents of local artists to design the labels, assuring that each style was unique in packaging as well as in style and taste. The launch of the Crooked Line was quickly followed by the grand opening of the Little Big Beer Store\u2014an on-site store selling higher alcohol content beers\u2014refrigerated!\r\nInspired by an upcoming 20th anniversary, Uinta Brewery sought a fresh approach in showcasing its products while maintaining the classic Uinta feel which reflects an appreciation for the outdoors and characteristics of the mountain west.  Uinta Brewing spent most of 2010-2011 going through a massive redesign of its logo, labels, all packaging and its bottle. The process enabled Uinta to clearly organize and define three lines of beers under the Uinta Family:  The Classic Line, Organic Line and Crooked Line. \r\nUinta designed a custom, proprietary 12 ounce bottle as part of the redesign project. Referred to as the \u201ccompass bottle,\u201d the new bottle shape is branded by a 360-degree compass embossed into the bottle\u2019s shoulder.  The upshot?  You\u2019ll never get lost with a Uinta bottle in hand!  Naturally, adopting the custom-shaped bottle gave rise to the need for a substantial investment in new bottling line equipment.\r\nThe redesigned logo embodies the uniqueness of the company\u2019s namesake, the Uinta Mountains.  A compass is integrated into the logo with the needle pointing East-West, referencing the only major range facing East-West in the continental U.S.. The compass also speaks to Uinta\u2019s sense of exploration and direction as Uinta consistently strives to brew the best beer possible. \u201cEarth, Wind and Beer\u201d remains part of the logo referring to Uinta\u2019s long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship. \r\nSince 2001 Uinta Brewing has been 100% wind-powered, becoming the first Utah company to reach this mark. In an effort to continue its commitment to using renewable resources, Uinta Brewing installed solar-electric paneling on the brewery\u2019s roof in 2011.  \r\n Uinta beers have received awards and medals from regional, national, and international competitions, including the North American Beer Awards, World Beer Cup, and Great American Beer Festival. \r\nUinta is committed to brewing world-class beer using the best practices and ingredients.",

This beer style is a light bodied beer fermented using a special top fermenting yeast strain, which we import specially from Germany, brewing it true to style. It is brewed with 80% pale-malted barley and 20% malted wheat. The pinpoint bitterness of the German Tettnang hops and crisp finish make this beer perfect for summertime enjoyment: it is available seasonally from May through July.",

Our publicly-held brewery employs over 150 people who are as passionate about quality craft beer as Kurt & Rob themselves.\r\n\r\nWe opened the brewery in 1984, and built a new 40-barrel brewing system in our current Russell Street location in 1990. We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

Here is a little rundown about what Fifty West is all about:\r\n\r\nAll the beers brewed at Fifty West Brewing Company have been hand made in small batches with a focus on craftsmanship, tradition, innovation, and patience.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why we selected the name \u2018Fifty West\u2019; the most obvious being the fact that our brewery is located on Route 50, which extends from Coast to Coast- it spans more than 3,000 miles starting in Maryland and stretching all the way to California. \r\n\r\nThe brewery is located in a building that has a vast and varied transient history (http://www.cincinnati.com/dining/heritage/history.html); from the settlers heading west through the Ohio River valley, to the days of Prohibition when our building was a favorite of George Remus and the bootleggers running whiskey from Cincinnati to Chicago, to where we are today\u2014amidst a renaissance of the craft beer movement.\r\n\r\nTo us, it\u2019s not about the destination, but instead making sure we are enjoying the journey, appreciating the moment, and brewing beers that are enjoyed by anyone who is willing to let us become a part of their journey.",

In the winter of 1984, David Geary began a period of training and research in Scotland and England. With the help of Peter Maxwell Stuart, a Scottish nobleman and brewer who arranged introductions and itineraries, he worked in a half-dozen small commercial breweries from the highlands of Scotland to the south coast of England.",

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

With a subtle fruit aroma, a hint of hops, a soft malt character and a slight dryness with a delicate pucker in the finish, this beer brings hints of summer all year around. 4.9% ABV, 23 IBUs. Best enjoyed fresh \u2013 drink it now, do not age. Store at 33F.  Serve at 37-42F in a Kolsch glass (very similar to that used for a Tom Collins) or a pilsner glass. Try it with light cheeses such as butterkase, fresh mozarella, or harvarti (ask the wonderful people at Cured in Boulder - 1825 Pearl - for more ideas).  It also goes well with lightly smoked sausages, pulled pork sandwiches, or rich, sweet desserts like chocolate hazelnut torte or toffee caramel cheescake.",

Light pearapple-Riesling wine-like fruitiness may be apparent, but is not necessary for this style. Caramel character should not be evident. The body is light to medium-light. This beer has low hop flavor and aroma with medium bitterness. Wheat can be used in brewing this beer. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold conditioning process. Fruity esters should be minimally perceived, if at all.

This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree\u2019s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery\u2026well, that\u2019s our story at Barrelhouse and we can\u2019t exactly prove it, but we\u2019re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.  We think it makes a sweet logo, too!\r\n\r\nAfter you pass the old oak, make a left on Limestone Way and look for the dragon fly\u2026you can\u2019t miss it. \r\n\r\nStop by, grab a brew or two and relax.  Enjoy our glorious beer gardens with friends while you listen to the waterfall and experience the central coast the way it was meant to be enjoyed\u2026outside.  You can also pull up to the bar inside the brewery where you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re part of the brewing action. Along with our amazing line-up of beers, we will also feature our very own custom crafted rootbeers.  If you ask nicely, we can even float a scoop of ice cream in your favorite sarsaparilla or stout.",

Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah. There are now more than 12 thriving brew pubs in the state thanks to Schirf and the bill's sponsor, Senator Mike Demeitrick of Price, Utah.",

Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.",

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.",

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.",

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors and was sold to other Cincinnati interests when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Company, the last remaining Cincinnati brewery. The lager of this era was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of further sales that took the business out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati, OH by its current local ownership. A brewery/gastropub has been opened on the Cincinnati riverfront and a major production facility is expanding in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district.  The company also owns the Hudepohl, Burger and Schoenling brands.",
