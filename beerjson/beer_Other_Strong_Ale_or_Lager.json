We hear what you\u2019re saying: \u201ca filtered Pretty Things lager\u201d? Nothing strange about that, we love to brew all sorts of beers!\r\n\r\nThis time we were looking to make the un-lawnmower beer (with an emphisis on the \u201cUN\u201d). Just how do we go about doing that? How about by starting with some of the world\u2019s greatest pilsner malt from Weyermann in Bamberg, Germany? There\u2019s no rice and corn in our darling either \u2013 just the best malted barley for purpose in the world. What else? All of the hops used in brewing American Darling come from the Hallertau hop region of Germany. Fermentation uses a blend of three of Europe\u2019s great lager yeasts, low temperature fermentation and lagering, over a period of six weeks. Yes, that\u2019s the UN lawnmower beer.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the process is to filter so that it can be more portable, without sediment to worry about disturbing. Put it in your coolers, your picnic baskets\u2026 your saddlebags. Take it to family reunions and pie eating contests, parades, beaches, fancy mustache conventions, hot dog factory tours, monorail excursions, secret basement lairs\u2026 wherever good summer fun happens!\r\n\r\nThen fire up the grill, not just once \u2013 how about like every day! Get out the horse shoes, kick up your feet and forget that oily red jalopy out back even has a purpose.",

Through the blending of 5 different malts, this beer features a complex, smooth and highly flavorful body with hints of nut, cocoa and a hint of coffee. With an airy, silky mouthfeel and such an incredibly complimenting series of flavors, Br\u00fcnette is sure to become your new favorite lager.\r\n\r\nBr\u00fcnette won a bronze medal in the American dark lager category at the 2010 World Beer Cup.",

There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.",

The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.",
