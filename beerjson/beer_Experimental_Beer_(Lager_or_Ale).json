This time, though, we tipped the scales in favour of beer, adding to the Duchessa wort only a 25% of wine must: in this case we used Malvasia (coming from our friends of Tenuta di Bibbiano, as usual), a white, aromatic grape variety which gives the beer a gentle and nice sharpness and an inusual, fruity nose. The beer is bottle-fermentd using Champagne-yeasts, and it has a quite intense \u201cperlage\u201d (bubbles) that makes it perfect as an aperitif or even for the whole meal. The \u201cchaotic\u201d label was designed byValentina De Luca, an Art student at the Istituto d'Istruzione Superiore Antonio Cederna of Velletri (Rome), who won our contest \u201cEtichette Bizzarre\u201d.",

Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

During this time, an ale known as K\u00f6ttbusser was outlawed because it contained oats, honey, and molasses. Over the centuries since its prohibition, K\u00f6ttbusser became a lost brewing style. At Grimm Brothers, we\u2019ve created an imperial version of this beer and named it Magic Mirror.   Magic Mirror is the antithesis ale to Snow Drop, brewed with more grains, honey and molasses and aged in oak, this beer is a malty big light colored ale.  It has just enough hops to balance the sweetness but leave a refreshing oak flavor on your tongue.",
