We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

It is considered by many to be ideal for dry hopping, but also gives a clean bitterness due to low cohumulone content. The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness. Amarillo is a registered trademark of Virgil Gamache Farms, Inc., where the hop was originally developed.",

It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

                    "description": "When the first Goose Island Brewpub opened its doors in 1988, domestic, mass-produced beer was deeply ingrained in Midwestern culture. The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

This tasty winter warmer started life as a small batch beer brewed for the Al Johnson Uphill Downhill a telemark ski race in Crested Butte, Colorado. The Uphill Downhill celebrates the exploits of Al Johnson, letter carrier extraordinaire, who delivered mail by ski in the late 1800 s. Dry hopping during fermentation creates a floral nose with a hint of pepper and spicy, subtle undertones. 2\u00b0 Below provides a bright, hoppy palate and a cheery warm afterglow.",

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.",

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.",

The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.",

For every landlord this means a longer shelf life than beer from conditioning tanks. And for the real ale people it means better, fresher tasting beer.\r\n\r\nVisitors are always welcome to the brewery shop for offsales - from two pints to a firkin for that special occasion, party or wedding.

We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.",

Pop started in the recession years of Reaganomics, thru the boom of Clintonia and still strong despite George II & the current class wars. Starting as a convenience store & gas station, we\u2019ve been evolving from pretty much day one, trying to offer quality and service like our friendly Travis Heights neighbors and fellow Austinites deserve.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to sustainable, local, and organic & natural produce and groceries with our offerings on the shelf as well as our kitchen menu (No high fructose corn syrup or MSG!!!) With 72 taps of beer available, we are quite picky on what we present with only quality brews that go with our food.\r\n\r\nWe also enjoy giving back to the community with nonprofit fundraisers and support for grassroots organizations.\r\n\r\nWe serve our very own authentic and unique Gujarati-style Indian food, mom approved.\r\n\r\nBeer by the pint & wine by the glass make it that much more of a yummy pairing.\r\n\r\nOur own brews are specifically designed for our menu items!\r\n\r\nAlso enjoy live music in our unique intimate and awesome music room, or at least our staff selections of eclectic tunes.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

We\u2019ve already had phone calls and emails from other brewers who are planning to follow in our footsteps, and we provide any help that we can. \r\n\r\nThe Brewery will consist of a 1.5 Barrel (or about 45 gallon) brewing system. Initially, distribution will be in 1/4 Barrel kegs to bars around the area, draft only. All the beer will be keg conditioned prior to distribution to ensure that it is at its maximum freshness, finishing the fermentation the moment it is loaded on a refridgerated truck out of the brewery.",

Willamette has a mild, grassy, floral and slightly spicy aroma similar to Fuggle, and is often used as a substitute, especially in the United States where Fuggle does not grow well. Willamette is extensively planted in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.",

No syrups, sugars or \"adjunct\" are used in our 100 percent grain mashes\u2014only barley and wheat malts, plus oatmeal in our special stout. All of our specialty malts are imported from the UK, as is our unique strain of yeast. The ales are naturally carbonated and left to settle or \"fine\" at cold temperatures, rather than being filtered. Filtration can remove much of the goodness from beer along with the haze. Another negative practice our Brewer avoids is pasteurization. Our natural and healthy brews are more lightly carbonated than the factory product, and served at a palatable 45 degrees F to bring out the fullness of the flavour for which we strive.",

Ft. pole building at the home of Don Wyatt, owner and brewer, just north of Poulsbo, Washington. Don had five years experience in home-brewing and worked at the Thomas Kemper Brewery before its closing. When Kemper's closed its doors, he decided to follow his passion and strike out on his own.\r\n \r\nDistribution of Hood Canal Beers started in Kitsap County. He later expanded his sales to the Seattle area via Odom Distributing Corporation, and now he personally distributes to bars, pubs, and grocery stores in Kitsap and surrounding counties.\r\n \r\nOur Tasting Room is on Bond Road between Kingston and Poulsbo. It's about the ten minute drive from the Kingston ferry terminal or from Poulsbo.",

Chainsaw is a connoisseur version of our awrd-winning Sawtooth Ale, designed to befuddle silly generalizations about life. This Double ESB pours a brilliant deep ruby amber with a rocky near white head. The nose opens with bright spicy and herbal hops, with hints of dried fruit and port. The flavor starts with a chewy, bready malt and hints of brulee and kola nut that are suddenly swept away by thyme-like and hoppy bitterness. The strong herbal flavors then give way to a dry finish of licorice, gentian, and Italian bitters. We hope you enjoy!",

All of our beers will be available in our taproom, which is located at the brewery. The taproom will have dartboards, a comfy lounge, and a few TVs for those days when the game is on. \r\n\r\nOur beer will also be available to the public. Ask for it at your local watering hole! \r\n\r\nAt Raleigh Brewing Company we intend to be a big part of the local Raleigh community. We plan to do that by staying as green as possible by reclaiming our water used to brew with, recycling, and conserving energy, donating money/beer/time to local charities, and opening up our space for local groups/organizations/events as much as possible. If there's anything you'd like to see us do, just shoot us an email! \r\n\r\nWe look forward to opening our doors and serving you some hand-crafted beers, which will hopefully be at the very beginning of 2013! \r\n\r\nCheers!",

Founded by Christian Sanders, the Aspen Brewery operated successfully in Aspen until being purchased by P.H. Zang Company of Denver in 1902.  We believe that they produced one beer, presumable a Lager, to quench the thirst of Aspen\u2019s mining population.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Flying Dog brew-pub was opened by George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre in the Cooper Street pedestrian mall.  Locals and visitors flocked to the brew pub for the beer, food and bohemian atmosphere.  Flying Dog operated in downtown Aspen for three years until moving to Denver.",

Conundrum walks the line between a malt-centric sweet ale and a hop-centric bitter ale so well, it\u2019s tough to describe. Quite the conundrum indeed! Think if it in simplest terms: it has a sweet malty profile like the Brown Bear Ale at first, though mostly caramelly instead of chocolaty, but then the taste sensation in your mouth changes to the floral bitterness of our secret hop recipe. If you love the Independence Pass Ale, but sometimes just want something a little \u2018mellower\u2019, something with a little more malt profile, this beer may be what you\u2019re looking for. If you like our Brown Bear but are thirsty for something with a bit more snap, give it a try! So far, everyone\u2019s loving the stuff!",

Spokane may be off the radar of the craft scene, but we wouldn\u2019t swap fame for the fortune of brewing in the very heart of the  Inland Empire with the World\u2019s finest hops and malts growing outside our door.

Willamette has a mild, grassy, floral and slightly spicy aroma similar to Fuggle, and is often used as a substitute, especially in the United States where Fuggle does not grow well.

Camusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.\r\n\r\nLocated in Chico, California, Sierra Nevada Brewing is one of the most popular craft breweries currently operating in the United States. Its Pale Ale is world renowned, and the brewery produces almost 700,000 barrels of beer per year. Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale is the second best-selling craft beer in the United States, behind the Boston Beer Company's Samuel Adams Boston Lager.\r\n\r\nSierra Nevada's specialty brews include the winter seasonal Celebration, which is similar to the pale ale, but hoppier; and Summerfest, a lager which is citrusy and sunny.",

Combining over 60 years of brewing experience with some of the big guys, Rick and Barry sought to create deliciously hand crafted ales and lagers that would bear no resemblance to the world of big beer.

We are 100% locally owned company with a 100% locally made product. \r\n\r\nEstablished in 2012 and officially opening our doors in 2013, Six String Brewing Company is all about great beer and great music! The idea of opening up their own brewery was spawned in 2009 after long term home brewer Chris had had enough of the IT and corporate world took to convincing old school friend, Adam that it was more than just a great idea. After a number of 'research trips' to Western Australia, New Zealand and the U.S it was a good 12 months before the idea got off the ground and the reality of what was involved began to hit home. After a number of false starts and a marathon of bureaucratic hurdles  the current location was secured in 2012 and the real fun of setting up the brew house and taproom began. \r\n\r\nSix String Brewing company has in the short time its been open has with chris' brews and Adams sales expertise gone from strength to strength and hope to continue spreading word of the craft beer revolution happening across Australia starting with the Central Coast.",

A beer like this changes greatly depending on the system used to dispense it. Served at cellar temperature from a traditional beer engine \u2013 the way UK expats demand it \u2013 you\u2019ll get a beer that\u2019s got a tight white creamy head, smooth and creamy mouthfeel and next to no carbonation. Serve the same beer through a standard refrigerated tap system and you\u2019re looking at a beer with a much lighter flavour and mouthfeel plus a slight chill haze. While some are convinced you can never fully replicate an authentic ESB unless you\u2019re in England, you can get pretty damn close. So, find this on a beer engine if you can but don\u2019t worry too much if you can\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s plenty in this beer to be enjoyed, however it comes.",

The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company",

The hop flavor is distinctly British, with a medium hop aroma and medium bitterness, and it interplays nicely with the body and the light, delicate carbonation. With its middle-of-the-road finish and its moderate strength, this is the perfect session beer. The overall impression is of a golden, moderately malty ale with medium hop flavor and bitterness. Expect to see it whenever the QCers\u2019 begging and pleading finally gets to me.",

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.",

The Holgate Extra Special Bitter is steeped in tradition - a hand-pumped naturally conditioned Real Ale, follows the English brewers tradition of denoting \"Extra Special\" beers as having a higher alcohol than a \"Mild\", with rich and complex malt additions and highly bittered with English hops. The Holgate version combines a special blend of crystal and roast malts and generous additions of English Fuggles and Goldings hops to create a very \"moreish\" Ale rich in flavour.\r\n\r\nSoftly carbonated and served through traditional Beer Engine at 8-10 Deg C at Holgate Brewhouse, this beer is a great accompaniment with full flavoured dishes - beef, game, duck.",

As the restaurant business thrived, the guys turned their attentions back to the enduring dream of opening their own brewery.\r\n\r\nThe guys decided that it was time to stop talking and start brewing.  They teamed up with Graham With, a respected home brewer; and Michael Tod, a friend with a wealth of sales experience in the BC craft beer industry.  The newly assembled Parallel 49 team set out to create the unique brand of Vancouver craft beer that they had been thirsting after for years.",

So began the friendship of Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit.\r\n\r\nAs they made their way through college they continued to experiment with homebrewing and formulating new recipes. Proud of their product, they were eager to share it with friends. An instant favorite, it wasn't long until they realized their modest homebrewing operation wasn't going to be enough to satisfy the growing demand.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1990s, many breweries opened, and craft brewing started to gain popularity. Working in a small English-style brewery in Western Maryland, Tom Kehoe and Jon Bovit decided to take matters into their own hands, and in 1994, they founded Yards Brewing Company.",

After first launching our lightly toasted, complex, full-flavored Toasted Lager, we rapidly gained the respect of beer lovers far and wide. Soon after, we introduced several other brews and were being compared to breweries from noted craft-brewing capitals like Denver, Boston, Portland, and Seattle.\r\n\r\nBrewing isn\u2019t just our business, it\u2019s our passion. We\u2019re beer people. We started Blue Point Brewing Company because we wanted to make beer we would drink. To quench that desire, we select only top-quality ingredients and brew all-natural, unpasteurized beer. It\u2019s this approach that put us on the world beer map. From the World Beer Cup to the Great American Beer Festival and the Australian International Beer Awards \u2013 we\u2019re becoming noticed the world over. But we believe you should be the judge.

Regardless, we think you\u2019ll find it to be an extraordinary drink. A World Beer Cup winner and beer enthusiast all-time favorite, this traditional English-style ale is made with 2-row pale and English crystal malt which is balanced by copious amounts of English hops. Our version of the full-bodied ale uses both Kent Goldings and Fuggles to impart a rich hop taste. So crack open a fresh jug of ESB, slice off a tasty piece of Gouda, sit back and enjoy this unapologetic, mouth-puckering, bitter, handcrafted ale.",

Moylan\u2019s features a 57 foot long bar, a dart room with a fireplace and a reading library featuring brewing books and magazines from Brendan\u2019s personal collection. By constructing the brewpub in an empty lot from his own vision, Moylan was able to increase efficiency and productivity, while still leaving room for expansion as the establishment\u2019s popularity grows. According to Moylan, the location at Rowland Plaza provides good freeway visibility and helps attract a greater number of customers from the nearby theatre and corporate offices. When Moylan co-founded Marin Brewing Company back in 1989 there were only about a 100 brewpubs across the country. Today, there are more than 2000.",

We support anything from school groups to ski clubs to horse rescue to the mentors program because, well, they support us and honestly it\u2019s the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nDough. We like dough. It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers! Peace.",

We brew small batches of about 100 gallons, ensuring that each beer is served at the peak of freshness. Our brews are available by the glass, pint, or pitcher and to-go in 1/2 gallon growlers and 5 gallon kegs. We make every attempt to keep all of our beers on tap at all times but once in a while one or two may not be available for a few days. These times are the perfect opportunity to stretch your taste and try something other than your favorite.

The Louisville area has had a number of quality brewpubs for some time now, but still there was simply not enough beer! Against the Grain is an effort to help solve this problem. We maintain a diverse array of beers covering all of the major categories of beer flavor while generating an endless stream of innovative new brews. In short, everything is \"specialty\" Boredom will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nOur food is designed with same philosophy as our brewing. Fresh and interesting smokehouse fare with a gastropub flare lets us bring you the very best flavors to stand alone and to compliment our beers. Regular menu changes allow us to take full advantage of the best seasonal ingredients, our chef's whim, and optimal pairing with our dynamic beer list.\r\n\r\nThrow your preconceived notions right the hell out the window. We aren't just another brewpub. We are Against the Grain!",

The potential of the beer was soon realised and ESB was installed as a permanent fixture, creating an immediate impact. \r\n\r\nNot only was it one of the strongest regularly brewed draught beers in the country (at 5.5% ABV), it was also one of the tastiest, and as the awareness of the beer grew, so did its popularity. ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since! \r\n\r\nWith three CAMRA Beer of the Year awards, two World Champion Beer awards, and numerous other gold medals to speak of, ESB is, quite simply, the Champion Ale.",

The first batch of Berghoff beer was brewed in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1887 by Herman Berghoff and his three brothers. Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.",

The tiny brewery quickly got people\u2019s attention the next spring when Dry Dock won Gold at the 2006 World Beer Cup for its HMS Victory ESB (now Amber Ale).\r\n\r\nExpanding in 2009 and again in 2011, Dry Dock currently runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location on Hampden Ave. in Aurora.\r\n\r\nIn January 2013, Dry Dock opened a production facility with a 40 BBL brewhouse and canning line in a second, 30,000 sq ft facility, to produce beers for distribution throughout Colorado. Dry Dock\u2019s production has grown from 300 barrels in 2006 to 3,200 in 2012. With the new facility, they will produce about 11,000 BBL in 2013. They have also continued to win medals at both the World Beer Cup and the Great American Beer Festival, including Small Brewing Company of the Year in 2009.",

It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.",

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

With a combined passion for craft beer, Kevin and Marisa set out to start the Vail Valley\u2019s first production brewery. Kevin and Marisa built their brewery from the ground up in a gutted warehouse, shipping in tanks and equipment from around the globe. Their first beer was poured at a beer festival in Vail in January 2010 and they started distributing their beer to local bars and restaurants in March 2010. After an initial expansion, they opened a tasting room to the public in October 2010.",

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

Like many other varieties developed at Wye, this hop is sometimes known as Wye Northdown, especially in older references. This simply indicates that it was developed at Wye, not necessarily anything about where it was grown. Northdown replaced Northern Brewer in many dark or strong British beers when it was released in 1970, including some Dry Stouts. Its distinctive flavor helped it survive in many beers even after the introduction of cleaner, higher-alpha varieties such as Target. Today it is sometimes sold under the name of \"Northern Brewer (Northdown)\", although the two cultivars are distinct.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

Today, Lake Placid Pub & Brewery has been brewing award-winning ales for 14 years and has expanded rapidly due to its popularity and quality, earning the respect of the brewing community.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Christopher Ericson and a college friend purchased P.J. O'Neill's, a pub in the small, Adirondack village of Lake Placid. They renovated the upstairs into a pub and restaurant, installed a seven barrel brewery, and began brewing. Chris' brewing experience included Federal Jack's / Shipyard Brewing in Kennebunkport, ME and The Shed Restaurant and Brewery in Stowe, VT.  The Lake Placid Pub & Brewery soon became a popular spot both for locals and visitors to the Lake Placid area.",

All of our beers are served up unfiltered and long-aged, to deliver maximum flavor and character. The beers can be very complex and assertive, but with the ultimate goal of proper balance. We aim to satisfy both the hardcore aficionados and the more casual craft beer fan, all in the same glass.\r\n\r\n In June of 2013, Matt purchased Charlie's shares of Double Mountain, vowing to continue the good work the two partners created.",

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.",

Some beer companies try to market their beer as being able to bring you a life of leisure; others may try to convince you that higher alcohol content automatically means better beer; others may simply try to sell you beer of poor quality and claim, \"It's a craft beer.\" People know better than that, and our goal is to make great beer and sell it at a fair price without using silly marketing gimmicks.\r\n\r\nOld Black Bear is not able to bring you a carefree life. If we could, we are undercharging for our product. However, what we can do is this: Provide you with a beverage that you can enjoy with your friends after a hardworking day, and assure you that every Old Black Bear Beer you drink will be of the highest quality and offer you drinkability and refreshment that is unmatched by any other small craft brewery ~ a real life beer you deserve.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

It was headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. In the last 20 years, S&N expanded significantly from its home base to become an international business with beer volumes growing almost tenfold. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but it was acquired jointly by Heineken and Carlsberg in April 2008, with the company's assets being split between them. The trading name \"Scottish & Newcastle UK\" continued to be used, until November 2009, to denote the UK trading operation of Heineken International until it was renamed \"Heineken UK\". The Scottish & Newcastle name lives on through the former \"S&N Pub Enterprises\" leased pub division which has been renamed \"Scottish & Newcastle Pub Company\".",

We think that once you taste the over-the-top hops and surprisingly sturdy malt backbone you will realize why it\u2019s worth it.  \r\n\r\nDefinitely not a fruit-extract seasonal shandy, this beer is meant to be enjoyed on the back porch, the front porch, or even on the stoop.

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

Old School is a British-style pale ale brewed with organic malts for an easy-drinking yet full-bodied character.  The real darling of Old School, though, is in the hops.  We went back and dug up some East Kent Goldings, traditionally used in all ales of British origin with a floral nose and an earthy, spicy, slightly sweet flavor.  From start to finish, this is great beer for celebrating the good times:  past, preset, and future.",

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.",

Our beers are never filtered or force carbonated. They condition and carbonate naturally in casks and are hand drawn by authentic beer engines at the perfect drinking temperature to maximize all the flavors. (No, they are not warm!) We really like beer, and we love cask conditioned real ales. We think you will too!",

                    "description": "Founded in 1852 by Gabriel Hail and John Albrecht, the Potosi Brewery began as a small brewery quenching the thirsts of area farmers, fishermen and miners. In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.",

And so Barhop Brewing was born. On brew days, you can hear Tom brewing to the tunes of Pearl Jam, Bob Marley, The Grateful Dead, Led Zepplin, and so on. Tom\u2019s California beer-drinking youth provided him with a strong affinity for the pioneers of micro-brewing, back when Sierra Nevada, Pete\u2019s Wicked, and Mendocino Brewing were small craft brewers. Decades of drinking beer \u2013 and specifically micro-brews \u2013 have contributed to Tom\u2019s brewing pedigree. (Or so he says.) Currently he is a big fan of Elysian and Russian River Brewing, and these companies have influenced his brewing style which he calls \u201caggressive California-style ales, with a Northwest twist, using fresh Northwest ingredients\u201d.",

Public Ale's name is an ode to a sessionable style that not only has been commonly found in English public houses for centuries, but can be enjoyed today by everyone within our Community.  \r\n\u200b\r\nESB was originally brewed by the English brewery Fuller, Smith & Turner of London (Fuller\u2019s ESB) in the mid 20th century as a winter ale.  At Community Beer Company we appreciate this timeless, quaffable beer style and will bring it to you year round as our \u201cPublic Ale.\u201d  In reverence to the best ESB\u2019s of England, we brew it with nearly all English ingredients: 100% English malts, a blend of English, German and American hops, our house ale English yeast strain and of course our own crystal clear, filtered water.  The subtle complexities of this beer begin with a base of 100% Maris Otter English pale malt \u2013 prized for its superior, rich, bready taste \u2013 which adds a malt complexity that is difficult to achieve with modern, higher yielding malt varieties.  English crystal malt increases the malt complexity, brings amber color and some residual sweetness, all of which mingles well with the fully expressed fruity esters developed by our house ale yeast during fermentation.  While the hops are noticeable, they are part of an integrated whole, leaving the beer very well balanced and drinkable.",

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history, beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education, but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system, with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series, has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single Hop,\r\nand R&D Series.",

Nikos was sampling a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant/brewery and through mutual friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question, \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing, it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17 hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield, Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house. Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community and\r\nthe root of human existence.

Effective July 1, 2012, Senate Bill 604 gives commercial breweries in Virginia the right to sell glasses of beer on-site. For more information on Senate Bill 604 and what it means for Virginia breweries, click here. In the case of the beers released with this name, the \"SB\" stands for \"session beer\" referring to ales or lagers of a milder alcohol content (typically lower than 4.0% ABV). The brewers who spent weeks lobbying on behalf of SB 604 with senators and delegates at Virginia's General Assembly plan to release different variations of SB 604 beers that will be session beers only available for consumption on site at their respective breweries. The \"Special Bitter\" version of this beer offered by Hardywood is very sessionable, at 3.8% ABV. A moderate caramel malt character and some fruity notes provide plenty of complexity and flavor to this beer, which beautifully complements citrusy, high alpha American aroma hops. Dry-hopped with slightly peppery horizon hops, this beer displays the high degree of balance that has become a signature of Hardywood's beers. A relatively dry finish keeps this beer both refreshing and enticing.", 
            "foodPairings": "Hardywood SB 604 - Special Bitter is a perfect match for just about anything off the backyard grill, but particularly burgers or steak, which has some carmelized notes to harmonize with the beer's malt character. Relatively hoppy, this beer stands up to spicy heat found in many Asian or Mexican dishes.",

In some cases--such as with our IPA, Imperial IPA and Imperial Oatmeal Stout--we push the envelope and make a very big and flavorful brew. Put simply, we brew the beers that we like to drink! \r\n\r\nWe are located in the heart of downtown Bellingham, WA and have been dubbed \"Pure Bellingham\" by the locals!  We continually win awards for our beer, have been named one of the top 25 breweries in the U.S. (by Steve Johnson, America's Best Brews), were declared the Best Brewery in WA (by the Northwest Brewing News Reader's Poll 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010) and are the only brewery in Washington to bring home the Alpha King award for our Imperial IPA.\r\n\r\nCome have a pint with us.

The brewery is now in Longmont, CO - a much larger town just east of Lyons. Oskar Blues is unique in that it serves craft-brewed beer in cans, contrary to the normal practice of bottling micro brews. The brewery is owned by Dale Katechis, a native of Florence, Alabama who brought canned beer and southern fried foods together for an interesting twist on the micro-brew pub.",

Most of us were born and raised in the Fair City, many of us travelled away, but some curious magnet brought us all home.  We  suppose it\u2019s something about this town\u2019s sublime natural setting, ironclad sense of  community, and wry underdog spirit.  Spokane may be off the radar of the craft scene, but we wouldn\u2019t swap fame for the fortune of brewing in the very heart of the  Inland Empire with the World\u2019s finest hops and malts growing outside our door.  We hope each of our beers proves worthy of this ideal situation we have rooted ourselves in.",

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.",

Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.",

Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.",

Brewmaster Christian Ettinger has spent the past year and half constructing his dream brewpub.  HUB incorporates all aspects of sustainability.  From composting to rain barrels, and from pervious pavers to hand dryers, we have made every effort to protect our future with a thoughtful alternative.  Hopworks has four distinct areas including a family friendly restaurant with play area, a vibrant bicycle bar, banquet mezzanine, and outdoor beer-garden.  Our 20 barrel brewery produces 3000 barrels a year and provides our restaurant with ten different HUB organic beers on tap and two cask ales at all times. We have parking for seventy cars, eight motorcycles and up to fifty bikes.  Our world-class beer, New York style pizza, and wonderful staff are some of the best you will find anywhere.",

Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.",

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",

The two dreamed of starting a Brewpub that offered many varieties of house-brewed ales and lagers and hearty made-from-scratch pub fare to accompany the beers. The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.",

In the beginning we had only one ale, the Guldenberg, named after the Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, where beer was brewed in the past. With a history in the beer world (since 1930 the Bacelle - Noffels family was active in beer commerce and as a lemonade producer), Nino had started experimenting with brewing ale in 1981. After an education as brewer at the CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about this formula is that it\u2019s possible to brew profitable without big investments. The Deca brewery is Woesten was chosen to do this and in the first year 9000 litres of Guldenberg were brewed.",

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.",

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).",

A fuller malt foundation than some other pale ales\t with some background spiciness.

The residual malt and defining sweetness of this richly flavored, full-bodied bitter is more pronounced than in other styles of bitter. It is light amber to copper colored with medium to medium-high bitterness. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions, but in bottled versions, a slight increase in carbon dioxide content is acceptable. Fruity-ester character is acceptable in aroma and flavor. Diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels. The absence of diacetyl is also acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. English or American hops may be used. (English and American hop character may be specified in subcategories.)",
